hey
welcome
back
certainly
glad
you
could
join
me
today
let's
start
out
and
have
them
graphically
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
do
this
painting
with
me
and
as
usual
they'll
come
across
in
exactly
the
same
order
as
I
have
them
laid
out
on
the
palette
starting
with
the
white
and
working
around
today
we
have
something
a
little
different
little
unusual
up
here
I've
taken
an
18
by
24
inch
canvas
and
I
have
it
vertical
that's
up
and
down
and
the
bottom
half
here
probably
always
not
it's
below
half
I've
covered
with
black
gesso
and
the
top
half
then
is
just
left
white
now
I've
covered
the
whole
top
half
with
liquid
white
it's
nice
and
wet
and
ready
to
go
as
usual
the
bottom
half
I've
started
up
here
with
a
alizarin
crimson
and
phthalo
blue
mixture
it
makes
a
lavender
graduated
into
a
mixture
of
Prussian
blue
and
a
little
bit
of
yellow
ochre
to
give
it
sort
of
a
green
issue
and
then
graduated
on
into
phthalo
blue
and
phthalo
green
so
we
have
a
lavender
a
dark
green
and
then
a
brighter
green
and
this
is
going
to
be
a
happy
little
seascape
so
let's
let's
take
off
you
can
have
some
fun
think
you'll
enjoy
this
one
I
will
start
off
today
with
phthalo
blue
reach
over
here
and
grab
some
midnight
black
and
mix
them
together
so
I
have
blue
and
black
blue
and
black
black
and
blue
whichever
way
there
we
go
that's
what
I
always
look
when
I
get
home
late
black
and
blue
all
right
let's
go
right
up
in
here
and
let's
just
drop
in
some
happy
little
little
sky
areas
just
use
a
little
crisscross
strokes
and
we'll
have
some
big
clouds
today
then
you'll
do
some
and
testing
big
clouds
so
we'll
make
this
guy
maybe
a
little
bit
darker
than
I
usually
do
just
so
that
the
clouds
will
stand
out
just
drop
in
some
some
basic
shapes
I'm
leaving
some
areas
open
here
and
in
those
open
areas
we'll
come
back
and
we'll
put
all
the
little
little
clouds
and
let
them
dance
around
and
have
fun
there
may
be
comes
right
on
down
like
it
doesn't
matter
and
if
you
get
down
here
to
this
color
that's
okay
too
no
big
deal
we
don't
make
mistakes
we
have
happy
accidents
there
I
know
you're
sitting
home
saying
why
I
sure
though
we
were
looking
cloud
Bob's
making
today
let's
see
if
we
can
straighten
him
out
okay
let
me
wash
a
mold
brush
wash
our
brush
we
just
odorless
paint
thinner
shake
it
off
just
beat
the
devil
out
now
then
with
a
clean
dry
brush
go
back
and
they
will
soften
this
and
sorry
if
you
pull
a
little
bit
this
color
into
the
light
area
there
we
go
just
soften
it
and
bring
it
together
let's
bring
it
together
our
basic
little
cloud
shape
is
still
there
okay
let's
have
some
fun
we
go
let's
take
out
the
brush
strokes
same
old
dirty
brush
don't
even
have
to
clean
it
this
time
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
some
bright
red
take
it
and
go
into
midnight
black
so
I
have
bright
red
and
midnight
black
and
just
tap
the
brush
into
the
color
just
tap
it
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
now
then
we
have
to
make
some
decisions
where
is
our
shadows
live
in
here
I'm
gonna
have
a
shadow
right
here
right
against
the
water
we
just
let
that
work
right
on
up
like
so
just
a
happy
little
shadow
that
lives
in
there
big
clouds
today
so
we
put
the
shadows
in
first
and
they
will
come
back
and
we'll
put
some
highlights
on
them
just
sort
of
look
around
here
and
make
it
like
a
big
decision
where
do
you
think
the
shadows
will
live
in
this
cloud
there
they
are
where's
the
Sun
Oregon
Oh
a
cloud
pretends
to
wherever
and
it's
not
a
big
deal
because
if
you
put
a
put
a
shadow
here
you
don't
like
they
will
just
cover
it
up
we
can
fix
anything
wash
the
brush
shake
him
off
this
is
the
fun
part
that's
crazy
now
then
I
could
carry
away
this
verse
cleaning
now
then
let's
take
a
little
bright
red
and
go
right
into
the
titanium
white
just
a
little
this
little
amount
of
bright
red
let's
see
pull
it
brush
through
there
build
a
lot
of
paint
into
it
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
then
let's
go
up
to
the
top
and
just
begin
making
all
those
fluffy
little
little
things
on
top
of
the
cloud
let
that
brush
just
dance
around
there
and
play
tiny
little
circles
tiny
little
circles
I'm
making
all
those
little
Fluffy's
that
live
in
the
clouds
bring
it
right
on
down
into
the
dark
here
write
it
on
down
now
if
you
pick
up
too
much
of
the
dark
color
just
stop
and
wash
your
brush
nothing
wrong
with
washing
your
brush
there
we
go
now
then
let's
put
some
light
area
right
in
there
right
there
see
there
told
you
that
it
would
be
easy
there
comes
a
nice
little
fluffer
clouds
are
free
they
just
float
around
the
sky
I
didn't
have
fun
there
one
of
the
freest
things
in
nature
hmm
totally
was
gonna
make
a
big
cloud
today
this
is
gonna
be
a
big
cloud
it
comes
right
on
down
they're
going
that
eat
up
a
whole
canvas
with
clouds
that's
all
right
if
you
learn
how
to
make
a
cloud
then
it's
worth
all
the
effort
learn
it
every
time
you
practice
you
learn
more
every
painting
you
do
you
learn
a
little
bit
more
and
you
know
in
your
heart
that
the
next
one's
going
to
be
even
better
each
one
gets
better
now
let's
take
a
2
inch
brush
and
use
just
the
top
corner
and
we're
just
going
to
mix
up
the
bottom
of
this
cloud
just
gently
gently
using
tiny
little
circles
mix
it
right
into
that
darker
color
don't
touch
the
top
of
the
cloud
yet
we
want
them
to
stay
strong
and
bright
shiny
right
now
if
you
begin
picking
up
paint
just
beat
the
brush
and
that
will
remove
the
excess
paint
see
just
blend
all
that
together
and
a
son
of
a
gun
or
a
Club
Penguin
bangle
happy
cloud
there
there
here
we
go
look
at
that
right
on
down
right
I
don't
down
as
I
say
that
just
removes
some
excess
pain
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
whole
cleaning
procedure
now
we're
going
to
fluff
this
clout
grab
it
and
pull
it
circle
so
big
circular
strokes
if
you
pull
straight
up
it's
going
to
look
like
it's
raining
up
and
that'll
bother
you
if
it's
raining
up
so
try
not
to
have
it
raining
up
pull
it
in
big
circles
big
big
circles
look
at
that
thing
now
we'll
come
to
the
next
layer
and
lift
it
up
like
so
just
grab
it
and
lift
it
upward
lift
it
upward
I'm
continually
beating
the
pain
out
of
this
brush
so
the
brush
remains
dry
and
relatively
free
of
color
well
just
a
clean
dry
brush
now
if
you
get
too
much
once
again
stop
and
wash
your
brush
it's
not
a
thing
in
the
world
wrong
with
washing
your
brush
there
we
go
very
lightly
just
blend
it
all
together
see
there
just
make
this
as
soft
as
you
want
it
like
so
very
like
me
very
very
light
three
hairs
and
some
air
and
that
quick
well
you
guys
one
heck
of
a
sky
now
then
if
you
want
to
add
little
details
in
it
you
could
come
back
in
here
see
and
you
can
still
go
back
and
put
little
little
floaters
it
float
around
in
there
you
still
change
the
shape
anything
you
want
to
do
you
can
do
here
blend
it
see
give
it
a
little
fluff
and
in
that
cloud
lays
right
out
there
right
out
there
in
front
of
the
rest
of
him
he
went
to
the
front
of
the
class
okay
all
right
now
we
can
wash
your
brush
we
got
a
little
sky
that
easy
daddy's
taking
off
there
you
go
now
go
ahead
and
clean
this
one
inch
brush
at
the
same
time
okay
we're
going
to
do
a
happy
little
seascape
today
so
maybe
one
of
the
easiest
ways
that
I
have
found
to
do
a
little
seascape
is
take
this
is
a
number
six
filbert
brush
I
will
put
a
little
white
on
it
I'm
just
going
to
go
up
here
the
thing
that
we're
most
concerned
about
is
the
one
big
major
wave
I
have
so
many
letters
saying
I
want
to
do
the
big
crashing
way
with
a
transparent
eye
okay
let's
go
right
here
now
decide
where
that
big
transparency
is
going
to
be
maybe
comes
right
down
I
guess
and
the
water
comes
wherever
you
want
it
in
and
down
something
like
so
this
is
just
to
give
you
an
idea
sort
of
a
guide
you're
really
not
committed
that's
all
you
need
right
about
there
that
sort
of
gives
us
something
to
to
work
by
ok
let's
take
a
fan
brush
I
will
start
with
just
plain
old
titanium
white
let's
go
right
back
here
in
the
background
this
is
just
plain
white
now
remember
this
color
already
on
the
canvas
and
it's
wet
don't
let
that
color
dry
now
we
can
go
right
back
in
here
look
at
that
see
here
this
make
little
strokes
like
it
and
it
mixes
with
the
color
it's
on
the
canvas
and
all
these
beautiful
little
effects
will
happen
automatically
automatically
I
like
to
do
these
capes
on
black
canvas
because
all
your
dark
is
already
in
there
for
you
watch
here
here's
here
something
is
fine
we'll
just
take
white
maybe
let's
go
right
in
here
I'll
do
this
like
it
look
at
that
say
I
know
you
say
hello
Bob
youdon't
this
time
you
may
be
right
let's
do
it
again
then
what
the
heck
they're
right
on
out
like
yeah
the
only
thing
we're
worried
about
isn't
this
part
right
here
we
don't
care
about
that
right
there
we
don't
worry
about
that
part
you're
just
worried
about
the
black
eye
watch
let
me
wipe
this
brush
off
and
get
all
the
excess
paint
off
of
Matt
it
see
which
way
this
is
going
that'll
give
you
a
guide
now
very
lightly
very
lightly
just
blend
that
color
back
this
gives
you
the
little
trough
as
its
called
trough
right
in
between
these
see
they're
all
of
a
sudden
it'll
start
making
sense
now
there
we
go
that
easy
very
easy
you
can
make
just
all
kinds
of
little
wave
things
happening
we
clean
the
gray
I'm
just
drying
it
on
a
paper
towel
go
back
into
my
white
now
then
let's
make
some
big
decisions
here
this
comes
as
OOP
and
then
it
comes
like
that
and
we'll
do
exactly
the
same
thing
again
just
very
gently
very
gently
bring
it
back
very
lightly
just
barely
caressing
the
canvas
you
get
too
much
paint
just
wipe
off
the
excess
all
right
all
right
no
you
could
do
that
this
is
one
of
the
nice
easiest
ways
I
have
ever
found
of
making
a
happy
little
seascape
there
we
go
okay
let's
take
and
worry
about
this
nice
transparency
here
so
for
that
I'm
going
to
take
white
white
titanium
white
and
the
least
little
touch
least
a
little
touch
of
the
cadmium
yellow
just
load
this
filbert
brush
full
of
paint
a
lot
of
painting
and
it
decide
where
your
little
transparency
or
the
light
parts
going
to
be
and
begin
laying
it
in
scrub
it
in
get
tough
with
it
right
along
the
top
and
then
gently
gently
gently
just
blends
right
on
out
to
nothing
then
we
need
to
you
can
do
this
as
many
times
as
you
want
to
achieve
a
desired
effect
or
a
desired
lightness
clean
your
brush
each
time
and
reload
it
with
paint
cause
you
want
this
to
be
bright
area
right
in
here
and
you
can
add
more
paint
to
it
and
if
you
begin
getting
a
buildup
of
paint
it
begins
getting
too
thick
I'll
show
you
a
sure
take
your
knife
and
just
scratch
it
off
see
value
remains
like
that
you
can
wash
it
go
back
say
at
each
time
it's
gonna
get
a
little
brighter
a
little
a
little
shinier
you
can
do
this
as
many
times
as
you
desire
and
here
you
begin
worrying
about
the
shape
of
this
major
wave
there
we
go
just
like
so
I
can
wash
the
brush
get
it
good
and
dry
hmm
now
then
with
a
clean
dry
2
inch
brush
very
lightly
very
lightly
I'm
going
to
begin
blending
this
little
transparency
here
and
here
I'm
going
to
grab
it
and
we
can
working
on
the
basic
shape
of
the
wave
as
it
goes
out
it's
going
to
get
flatter
and
flatter
see
there
how
easy
that
is
that
might
have
to
be
hard
that
gives
us
some
of
our
initial
shapes
okay
clean
metal
brush
beating
dry
let
me
find
another
fan
brush
here
okay
go
right
into
titanium
white
right
into
it
there's
a
little
blue
in
that
color
too
so
it's
not
pure
white
a
little
tiny
bit
of
blue
that
was
left
over
let's
go
up
here
and
then
this
way
he's
gonna
be
crashing
over
this
comes
over
here
and
goes
choo
got
to
make
those
little
noises
or
it
won't
work
okay
reloaded
loaded
touch
touch
see
they're
easy
that
is
pick
up
too
much
of
the
under
color
you
may
have
to
wash
your
brush
several
times
that's
all
right
that's
sorry
yeah
let
go
back
and
get
our
little
filbert
brush
take
some
white
some
let's
use
some
alizarin
crimson
and
a
little
bit
of
a
little
bit
of
a
little
blue
or
crimson
and
we'll
go
in
a
little
darker
whoo
and
we're
getting
there
there
we
go
that's
what
I'm
looking
for
a
dark
lavender
looking
color
blue
the
bristles
full
of
paint
just
really
rub
it
in
there
telescope
here
now
maybe
there's
some
nice
foam
splashing
on
here
we're
putting
in
the
shadow
for
the
fall
just
scrub
it
in
scrub
it
in
scrub
it
in
hard
work
on
working
your
basic
shape
here
now
maybe
it
splashes
chilly
up
like
it
comes
right
around
this
is
the
shadow
this
is
the
shadow
this
is
where
you
put
the
dark
part
of
your
foam
in
clean
your
brush
you'll
be
an
expert
pressure
washer
by
the
time
this
is
over
be
sure
the
brush
is
dry
though
that's
most
most
important
okay
now
then
I'm
going
to
go
back
into
white
with
a
absolute
least
little
touch
of
the
cadmium
yellow
probably
can't
hardly
even
see
any
in
there
but
there's
a
little
touch
in
least
at
least
little
touch
okay
let's
put
some
highlight
on
this
phone
now
sort
of
hold
a
brush
to
the
side
here
and
give
it
a
little
upward
push
so
that
when
it
hits
at
the
top
then
it
makes
all
those
little
splashes
and
if
one
side
gets
wore
out
all
the
colors
use
turn
it
over
it's
got
two
sides
on
right
off
the
excess
and
you
go
back
in
there
and
get
you
a
little
more
there
we
go
just
place
that
in
there
can
you
wipe
it
between
at
least
wipe
it
between
each
application
so
you
get
that
dark
color
off
stairs
getting
dirty
give
it
a
good
good
wash
there
we
go
pick
up
a
little
more
white
little
touch
it
yellow
in
it
there
we
go
now
let's
go
right
in
here
got
to
make
those
little
noises
there
we
go
and
just
let
it
come
right
up
here
and
great
to
Horizon
Oh
kinds
of
happy
little
splashes
see
there
we
go
splash
right
there
hmm
no
super
little
way
though
to
make
like
a
happy
seascape
now
find
out
if
you
have
a
really
delicate
touch
just
a
corner
of
the
brush
just
the
corner
and
just
gently
gently
just
sort
of
wine
do
that
just
little
tiny
daddy's
little
circles
barely
touching
the
brushes
hardly
moving
just
sort
of
blend
it
all
together
see
how
softened
look
at
that
water
churning
there
you
don't
so
say
you
don't
have
to
be
crazy
to
do
this
but
it
does
help
yeah
yeah
that's
fine
there
we
go
let's
really
get
let's
get
wild
today
we'll
go
right
back
in
to
the
white
right
back
yet
maybe
right
along
in
here
maybe
there's
a
there's
another
little
doer
comes
right
out
my
cat
and
it
will
blend
this
one
back
and
this
begins
making
the
shape
of
the
large
wave
here
see
this
is
picking
up
that
colors
underneath
all
the
beautiful
colors
we
had
here
we
head
for
beginning
to
hit
the
phthalo
green
and
phthalo
blue
mixture
yes
begin
coming
together
this
is
we
create
the
shape
of
that
wave
so
angles
are
very
important
pay
attention
to
them
here
very
very
important
of
course
now
any
big
mass
seascape
needs
a
stone
for
them
for
the
way
you
used
to
be
crashing
against
we
got
us
a
splash
so
let's
put
a
stone
right
here
I
want
to
break
the
horizon
with
that
so
it
comes
right
on
up
maybe
this
is
a
big
tall
stone
look
bump
out
here
wherever
this
is
just
straight
Van
Dyck
Brown
oh
you
need
is
just
a
basic
little
little
rocks
here
whatever
you
think
your
rock
should
look
like
that's
what
it
all
look
like
there
we
go
and
then
I'm
going
to
take
the
fan
brush
and
won't
take
some
paint
thinner
on
the
fan
brush
and
go
right
in
-
straight
right
red
but
it's
very
thin
very
thin
this
is
bright
red
distend
with
paint
thinner
very
thin
okay
now
then
let's
just
take
this
and
go
right
over
the
edge
of
the
rock
you
can
do
this
with
a
liner
brush
and
really
put
a
lot
of
detail
into
it
I
just
don't
have
time
here
to
set
into
it
one
stroke
at
a
time
but
at
home
if
you
want
to
really
shape
these
rocks
take
a
liner
brush
and
you
can
just
make
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
facts
maybe
there's
another
little
ah
see
there
see
there
Oh
Karen's
a
happy
little
things
and
just
sort
of
bland
about
just
go
on
and
oh
maybe
there's
a
seeker
just
as
many
as
you
want
or
its
view
knowing
taker
our
burst
it
has
the
white
on
it
just
begin
putting
some
little
splashers
down
here
at
the
bottom
lift
it
up
lift
it
up
and
we
can
begin
working
all
kinds
of
happy
little
things
tell
you
what
I
see
let
me
get
the
small
knife
I
see
right
in
here
another
happy
little
stone
right
there
right
there
and
he's
got
a
friend
well
tell
you
what
I
got
I
got
another
idea
got
another
idea
when
you're
painting
these
you
just
look
up
here
you
see
all
kind
of
things
happening
let's
put
a
little
highlight
on
here
this
is
just
a
natural
this
is
a
natural
let
me
grab
a
little
white
maybe
this
there's
another
little
way
you
come
in
here
and
it's
splashing
up
against
the
bottom
of
this
and
there's
just
falling
and
churning
and
carrying
on
see
there
and
easy
working
layers
now
maybe
there's
another
happy
stone
right
there
he's
a
little
smaller
and
we
just
use
the
knife
and
put
a
little
touch
of
highlight
right
there
on
him
go
back
find
some
foam
around
his
foots
rock
dates
and
foam
if
it's
churning
over
I
have
sort
of
blue
and
white
on
here
we
can
begin
creating
all
kinds
of
little
own
patterns
in
here
just
like
so
all
of
the
angles
in
your
wave
so
most
most
important
maybe
here's
one
spilling
over
coming
down
they
use
some
little
holes
in
there
just
like
so
Oh
kinds
of
little
things
sometimes
you
I
like
to
use
a
fan
brush
you
can
just
do
beautiful
little
effects
with
it
like
so
make
it
look
haulin
like
water
all
kinds
of
little
things
going
on
and
you
can
really
get
carried
away
and
spend
a
lot
of
time
making
beautiful
beautiful
effects
yeah
let's
take
I'm
going
to
take
a
touch
of
paint
thinner
right
into
the
brightest
color
that
yellow
and
white
and
I
want
to
highlight
just
these
little
edges
here
I
could
come
right
on
down
see
there
there
we
go
back
in
here
or
the
light
striking
this
put
all
kinds
of
little
details
back
here
this
is
what
really
really
makes
you
seascape
stand
out
all
these
little
doers
see
if
that
I'm
will
rounder
back
up
through
here
and
you
can
you
can
just
take
and
put
hundreds
of
these
in
just
hundreds
of
just
wherever
you
think
they're
to
go
saying
something
here
this
is
where
you
create
the
shape
of
the
wave
use
a
lot
of
paint
thinner
so
that
pain
is
very
thin
think
we're
light
would
strike
in
here
see
how
the
little
details
you
can
just
drop
in
that
easy
easy
you
can
do
it
do
you
ever
think
you
could
make
such
a
seascape
so
easy
I
like
his
black
and
white
canvas
is
they
they
open
whole
new
worlds
to
you
you
can
do
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
effects
there
we
go
all
kinds
a
little
the
things
that
are
happening
in
the
water
see
there
and
you
can
take
the
blue
and
white
but
the
line
regression
put
all
kinds
of
little
watery
things
rippling
down
the
side
here
I
think
I'll
give
you
a
good
idea
of
how
to
do
a
fantastic
little
seascape
quite
fast
so
take
a
little
other
bright
red
will
sign
this
one
right
here
good
thing
I
have
a
short
name
doesn't
take
but
just
a
second
I
hope
you've
enjoyed
this
and
I
hope
you
two
enjoy
painting
along
in
and
doing
a
fantastic
seascape
and
from
all
of
us
here
I'd
like
to
wish
you
happy
painting
god
bless
and
I'll
see
you
next
time
you
