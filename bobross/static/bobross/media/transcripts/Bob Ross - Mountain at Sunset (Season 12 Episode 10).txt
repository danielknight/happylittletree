hi
I'm
glad
to
see
again
today
thought
today
we'd
do
something
a
little
bit
different
I
have
mold
canvas
up
here
as
usual
but
I've
covered
the
day
with
a
thin
even
coat
of
liquid
clear
and
let
me
say
it
again
thin
coat
you
need
very
very
little
of
this
and
this
is
nice
when
you
want
to
use
colors
that
are
say
transparent
and
you
want
to
get
sort
of
a
different
effect
so
I
tell
you
what
let's
have
them
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
and
while
they're
doing
that
let's
go
on
up
here
and
get
started
I'm
gonna
start
today
with
a
small
amount
of
Indian
yellow
just
the
least
little
amount
on
the
two
inch
brush
just
just
have
a
little
color
in
there
let's
make
a
nice
little
I
like
a
little
sunset
back
here
like
so
we'll
just
start
and
just
drag
a
little
color
across
like
it
like
that
you
know
since
we
introduced
them
the
clear
oh
I
don't
know
several
series
back
we've
got
so
many
letters
people
are
doing
such
fantastic
paintings
with
it
and
I've
used
it
mainly
for
seascapes
and
the
letters
are
asking
can
we
can
we
do
landscapes
and
stuff
with
it
absolutely
absolutely
so
today
I
want
to
show
you
how
you
can
do
a
fantastic
put
a
landscape
using
the
clear
right
into
crimson
alizarin
crimson
still
using
the
same
brush
have
not
washed
it
okay
I'm
go
right
up
above
the
yellow
and
just
begin
laying
that
in
the
color
was
still
yellow
in
the
brush
you
gonna
get
a
nice
orangey
color
beautiful
in
color
then
we're
going
to
blend
it
down
into
the
yellow
these
colors
are
very
transparent
so
you
get
some
beautiful
effects
you
can
get
just
a
touch
more
of
the
the
crimson
on
my
brush
here
giannis
blend
right
on
down
like
so
but
you
need
very
very
very
small
amount
of
this
liquid
clear
can't
say
that
enough
times
that's
probably
the
biggest
single
mistake
made
just
putting
too
much
of
it
on
the
canvas
one
jar
oh
my
gosh
you
last
you
for
years
there
we
go
I'm
just
going
to
add
a
little
bit
of
that
same
color
down
here
into
the
water
like
that
whatever
we
put
in
the
sky
will
add
a
little
into
the
water
to
just
sort
of
blend
that
together
tell
you
what
I'm
going
to
do
I'm
going
to
add
a
little
bit
more
crimson
because
now
we
wiped
most
of
the
yellow
out
of
brush
I
sort
of
look
a
little
a
little
more
into
the
red
issue
I
want
it
to
be
a
little
brighter
right
above
that
so
we
have
just
layers
of
different
colors
very
pleasing
nice
little
colors
maybe
mmm
right
there
just
a
little
touch
more
and
with
this
ladies
wander
on
up
into
the
sky
wherever
you
want
it
it
takes
very
very
little
color
when
you're
using
transparent
colors
on
top
of
the
clear
very
little
color
on
the
brush
now
they're
a
little
bit
more
down
here
too
it's
a
little
brighter
in
the
sky
should
be
a
little
brighter
in
the
water
now
that
I
have
him
Google
into
they
low
blue
I
have
not
washed
the
brush
yet
they
loo
blue
of
each
up
here
and
grab
a
little
de
crimson
very
little
crimson
just
enough
to
just
enough
to
give
it
a
slight
lavender
you
with
very
blue
yet
very
blue
you
just
drop
a
little
bit
of
that
off
this
little
blue
is
very
transparent
there
okay
we'll
just
break
it
down
to
about
like
it
and
let
it
stop
same
thing
that
we'll
put
some
into
the
water
to
have
some
in
the
water
and
I'm
not
sure
who
we're
going
to
have
land
down
here
yet
but
it
doesn't
matter
because
you
can
put
the
land
right
over
this
color
and
wherever
you
want
it
that's
where
to
be
okay
there
will
get
another
brush
I
have
several
of
each
brush
and
in
with
a
good
dry
brush
I'm
gonna
blend
this
together
this
is
very
dry
sure
it's
good
and
dry
because
the
clear
and
paint
thinner
will
react
quite
violently
so
be
sure
your
brushes
dries
you
can
get
it
might
even
wipe
it
across
a
paper
towel
before
you
do
this
there
we
go
okay
now
that
what's
really
neat
after
you
have
all
these
transparent
colors
on
top
of
the
clear
is
to
begin
adding
little
layers
of
opaque
color
and
titanium
white
for
example
is
very
opaque
so
let
me
show
you
here
we'll
take
the
the
old
knife
pull
the
paint
out
very
flat
and
just
cut
across
get
us
a
little
roll
of
paint
and
let's
put
let's
put
some
little
streaky
clouds
back
here
all
you
have
to
do
it
just
a
rub
it
across
a
canvas
just
rub
all
there
is
to
it
whatever
you
want
to
see
there
a
little
roll
of
paint
that's
all
you
need
and
we
got
us
some
happy
little
clouds
very
lightly
you
can
blend
those
see
how
that
opaque
color
though
stands
out
against
the
all
the
transparent
colors
and
you
can
take
the
large
brush
and
maybe
in
here
if
you
want
to
put
the
indication
of
a
little
little
cloud
it's
just
sort
of
floating
around
just
take
the
brush
and
very
quickly
drop
it
in
it's
unreal
what
you
can
do
with
this
can
make
some
of
the
most
beautiful
and
striking
effects
okay
have
it
today
let's
build
us
a
let's
build
us
a
mountain
I'm
going
to
start
with
black
and
Van
Dyke
Brown
a
little
bit
of
Prussian
blue
in
it
like
oppression
blue
Van
Dyke
Brown
should
be
very
dark
mostly
black
okay
once
again
we
cut
off
that
little
roll
of
paint
it's
great
up
here
now
then
let's
have
a
big
mountain
that
lives
there
he
goes
right
about
here
I
let
him
drop
down
see
there
you're
just
putting
wherever
you
want
it
very
dark
go
and
the
only
thing
you
worried
about
is
this
nice
outside
it
you
could
care
less
what's
happening
inside
here
and
we're
just
letting
flow
right
on
off
here
big
son
of
a
gun
really
push
that
right
into
the
fabric
right
into
the
fabric
scrape
off
all
the
excess
paint
we're
gonna
get
an
edge
and
scrape
it
okay
Gavin
I
take
a
large
brush
grab
this
and
pull
it
because
it's
wet
because
it
clears
on
here
it'll
move
there
go
just
let
it
blend
downward
this
removes
excess
paint
and
also
gives
the
illusion
that
there's
mist
at
the
base
of
this
mountain
I
just
let
it
where
on
the
right
on
off
we
don't
know
where
it
goes
don't
let
it
care
where
ever
you
want
it
to
go
just
take
the
brush
and
tap
okay
now
then
let's
put
some
highlights
on
there
I'm
going
to
take
go
take
some
dark
Sienna
clean
off
a
little
spot
here
we
take
dark
Sienna
take
some
bright
red
and
ah
reach
up
here
to
get
some
white
and
pull
it
through
and
little
yellow
ochre
just
but
add
all
these
colors
sort
of
in
layers
here
see
don't
over
mix
it
let
all
kind
of
things
happen
okay
now
then
when
you
cut
across
there
all
those
different
things
will
be
writing
that
roll
of
paint
all
these
different
colors
if
you
just
cut
straight
across
they're
still
there
and
you
can
come
right
up
here
no
pressure
and
you
can
just
lay
them
all
alone
here
like
this
all
kinds
of
little
different
things
are
happening
in
there
all
kinds
of
beautiful
beautiful
colors
that
easy
okay
put
some
up
here
on
this
big
son
of
a
gun
let
it
come
down
wherever
you
want
to
there
see
just
let
all
these
things
happen
people
will
think
you
work
for
months
to
get
all
these
different
colors
and
it's
all
in
the
loading
of
the
knife
all
in
the
loading
it
happens
automatically
you
don't
even
have
to
worry
about
it
you'll
get
this
small
knife
I
want
to
go
over
the
other
side
for
I
do
too
much
here
we're
putting
some
put
in
some
shadows
I'll
take
some
Prussian
blue
a
little
touch
of
white
into
it
and
let's
go
right
up
here
got
a
little
bit
of
dark
Sienna
in
there
too
and
just
pull
it
down
Prussian
blue
dark
soon
and
I'm
not
mixing
these
very
much
don't
want
to
what
I'm
hardly
a
mixed
at
all
just
pull
down
okay
maybe
the
do
it
that
way
right
in
here
get
a
little
bit
more
see
that
sample
think
about
it
all
kinds
of
beautiful
beautiful
striking
little
highlights
maybe
right
here
we'll
have
this
one
cut
right
on
down
they'll
have
a
little
projection
here
and
wear
this
with
a
little
meat
director
just
wherever
you
want
to
just
sort
of
work
your
colors
back
and
forth
that'll
come
together
come
together
like
so
but
you
can
make
some
of
the
most
fantastic
little
effects
and
they
just
sort
of
happened
just
sort
of
happen
now
then
will
bring
us
maybe
right
on
around
just
make
up
your
mountain
the
way
you
want
it
there
we
go
let's
take
a
little
bit
of
light
color
maybe
the
lights
really
the
zinging
right
through
there
please
all
in
that
dark
area
it's
a
super
way
though
to
make
some
of
the
most
beautiful
little
mountain
bikes
you've
ever
seen
okay
that
gives
us
a
pretty
nice
little
Mountain
let
me
find
a
clean
dry
two
inch
brush
and
I
just
want
to
tap
the
base
of
this
mountain
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
of
mist
down
here
so
all
you
need
to
do
is
just
tap
it
tap
it
following
the
angles
and
then
gently
lift
it
upward
gently
gently
gently
I
always
follow
those
angles
though
it's
most
important
that'll
create
the
illusion
of
mist
at
the
base
of
that
mountain
yeah
let's
take
we
use
that
same
same
basic
old
mountain
color
it's
black
and
blue
little
brown
in
it
very
dark
though
should
look
black
okay
continue
to
pull
it
out
flat
get
our
little
roll
of
paint
or
add
out
on
the
edge
and
maybe
here
let's
do
this
let's
get
brave
today
maybe
this
big
son
of
a
gun
just
comes
right
on
down
a
little
bump
right
there
just
sort
of
let
it
go
very
dark
I
want
distant
to
almost
be
black
very
dark
and
we'll
play
some
games
with
contrast
here
if
you
had
the
liquid
white
on
the
canvas
when
you've
done
this
it
would
dilute
your
color
would
not
be
near
is
dark
and
I
want
this
to
be
very
very
dark
should
look
black
okay
now
I'll
grab
that
I
just
pull
it
there
we
go
mmm
that
is
very
rich
very
dark
and
I'm
going
to
take
Prussian
blue
and
white
but
mixed
very
very
dark
I
want
very
dark
I
had
a
little
black
to
that
there
very
dark
cut
off
a
little
bit
of
paint
I
just
want
to
put
the
indication
here
just
here
and
there
that
may
be
a
little
light
is
striking
this
old
dark
dark
mountain
but
there's
virtually
nothing
there
it
is
very
dark
just
a
little
shadow
here
and
there
on
it
I
know
if
that'll
show
up
early
there
we
go
mm-hmm
now
then
while
we
had
that
dark
color
on
the
brush
let's
make
us
a
little
reflection
underneath
that
we're
gonna
need
a
reflection
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
just
grab
a
little
of
that
and
pull
it
down
with
straight
down
straight
down
just
like
so
there
we
go
down
straight
down
straight
down
straight
down
and
very
lightly
just
come
across
you
can
push
that
paint
to
make
those
reflections
wiggle
and
move
okay
now
maybe
behind
a
fan
brush
maybe
back
here
we'll
take
some
yellows
some
yellows
and
I'll
get
into
some
greens
dark
green
here
dark
dark
green
maybe
there's
some
little
land
areas
back
in
here
this
is
very
dark
green
just
push
these
in
like
so
Jan
is
pushing
in
now
go
back
into
the
same
yellow
color
and
just
add
a
little
more
to
the
brush
and
it'll
be
lighter
a
little
yellow
ocher
cad
yellow
indian
yellow
okay
let's
go
back
add
it
I
want
to
come
back
in
here
and
just
put
the
indication
of
a
few
little
highlights
these
are
distant
little
trees
and
bushes
that
are
far
away
can't
make
out
a
lot
of
detail
on
these
they're
just
enough
to
make
them
shine
a
little
bit
oh
yeah
we
will
take
a
little
brown
and
just
put
in
the
indication
of
a
little
bit
of
land
this
Van
Dyck
Brown
right
along
in
there
take
a
little
bit
of
the
liquid
white
pull
it
out
very
flat
and
with
that
then
come
right
in
here
and
cut
us
in
waterline
see
how
that
stands
out
dark
against
light
contrast
all
this
wild
contrast
there
we
go
then
take
a
fan
brush
this
is
number
three
fan
brush
don't
email
feasel
she'll
I
just
want
to
put
the
indication
here
and
there
about
distant
evergreen
tree
just
a
few
right
in
there
when
you
do
them
at
home
though
you'll
be
able
to
see
a
much
better
just
a
little
evergreens
back
in
there
okay
tell
you
what
let's
really
have
some
fun
now
take
the
old
two
inch
brush
them
go
right
into
Van
Dyck
Brown
pick
up
some
alizarin
crimson
a
little
bit
of
dark
Sienna
just
whatever
leave
them
a
little
SAP
green
just
throw
it
all
in
there
together
tap
some
color
in
there
all
right
let's
have
right
in
here
let's
have
some
beautiful
beautiful
little
bushes
and
trees
just
tap
use
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
tap
quite
firmly
maybe
these
son
of
a
guns
just
there
they
go
go
right
on
off
the
top
of
the
canvas
here
right
over
my
mountain
and
begin
making
some
nice
branches
and
limbs
we
were
right
into
a
little
touch
of
yellow
ochre
and
just
begin
mixing
that
right
on
the
canvas
and
in
the
brush
want
to
get
a
little
lighter
toward
the
top
there
and
this
is
the
back
of
the
tree
we
paint
the
back
of
the
tree
and
we'll
come
back
and
paint
the
middle
of
the
tree
which
is
a
trunk
and
then
we'll
put
the
highlights
on
can
go
back
into
a
little
more
on
the
brown
I
have
to
start
making
some
big
decisions
here
where
do
you
want
you
to
lay
out
to
go
maybe
it
goes
right
out
here
like
that
just
wherever
maybe
out
through
there
just
decide
where
you
want
it
and
drop
it
in
pull
that
straight
down
a
little
bit
go
across
give
us
the
indication
of
a
happy
little
reflection
and
maybe
maybe
over
here
on
the
other
side
maybe
there's
some
more
over
here
same
colors
round
little
bit
alizarin
crimson
there
just
whatever
you
got
good
dark
color
maybe
there'll
be
a
little
reflection
here
too
okay
yeah
then
let's
come
back
in
here
and
we
need
a
we
need
a
tree
trunk
or
two
some
will
go
right
into
Van
Dyck
Brown
with
a
fan
brush
right
in
there
and
back
in
here
back
in
here
we'll
make
some
a
few
little
trunks
we
don't
know
how
many
trunks
are
back
here
and
you
may
can
only
see
parts
of
them
here
and
there
just
wherever
maybe
just
a
blur
this
one
right
here
comes
down
and
you
know
me
you
know
me
I
like
he's
old
big
trees
there's
one
tune
just
throw
him
in
and
he's
got
a
friend
here
this
friend
this
friend
is
a
really
a
big
tree
he
lives
little
further
into
the
foreground
big
side
oh
my
god
that'll
sort
of
give
you
an
idea
for
your
trees
live
maybe
tell
you
what
tell
you
maybe
there's
one
or
two
on
the
other
side
over
here
we
can
just
sort
of
block
them
in
all
we
have
the
little
brush
boy
there's
one
there's
one
there
it
comes
soup
that
easy
it
will
give
him
a
friend
there
just
like
so
yeah
then
go
back
to
a
two
inch
brush
and
I'm
just
going
to
tap
it
into
some
of
the
greens
and
the
yellows
and
Indian
yellow
yellow
ochre
just
tap
it
just
have
it
okay
now
then
let's
begin
putting
all
terms
of
just
a
little
grassy
things
that
are
growing
out
here
wherever
you
want
to
where
ever
there's
one
tell
you
what
let's
do
let's
have
some
nice
rocks
live
out
here
-
we
need
a
nice
stone
it
lives
there
is
nice
big
old
stone
and
in
your
world
you
decide
where
all
these
little
rocks
and
stones
live
can
just
drop
them
in
just
put
them
in
whatever
you
want
give
it
a
long
little
touch
a
high
light
up
here
hmm
that's
pretty
Purdy
like
so
there's
I'm
right
there
see
how
easy
it
is
to
make
all
these
little
rocks
okay
maybe
we
want
someone
-
yeah
we
can't
leave
this
side
out
we
put
a
big
one
right
out
here
lives
out
here
on
the
corner
he
watches
and
sees
what
happens
out
here
there
we
go
put
some
highlights
on
him
it's
a
little
Brady
shiny
thanks
out
there
they're
the
same
colors
we
were
used
on
the
mountain
just
sort
of
mixed
on
the
knife
sort
of
let
them
happen
okay
like
I'll
take
a
one-inch
brush
here
let
me
get
a
one-inch
brush
go
into
a
little
touch
of
a
little
touch
of
the
liquid
white
right
into
some
of
my
yellows
and
greens
pull
that
brush
in
one
direction
I
load
a
lot
of
paint
on
it
okay
let's
use
that
and
come
up
here
what's
on
bright
sparkling
little
bushes
and
use
it
side
words
and
just
push
these
Rascals
in
wherever
you
want
maybe
there's
some
hid
back
in
here
these
are
little
darker
not
as
much
lights
gonna
hit
them
back
in
here
there
they
are
see
how
they
had
to
spring
them
down
so
they
cover
up
the
edges
of
your
rock
I
could
look
finished
and
all
I'm
doing
is
just
pushing
up
with
a
side
and
work
working
layers
completing
the
most
distant
layer
and
coming
forward
maybe
there's
another
big
stone
that
lives
here
see
there
yes
there
he
is
a
little
light
on
him
shoot
maybe
there's
even
a
little
blue
on
this
side
here
to
make
a
shadow
I
had
easy
okay
then
we
could
put
some
little
grassy
things
down
here
his
foots
school
bring
the
other
side
and
do
that
over
here
too
that's
a
nice
one
just
wherever
you
think
they
should
live
get
carried
away
and
cover
up
all
your
little
rocks
and
stones
also
be
careful
and
then
we
go
back
into
our
liquid
white
put
us
in
a
little
water
line
in
here
just
like
so
see
it
cleans
up
all
the
edges
brings
it
all
together
if
you
don't
have
the
clear
you
could
certainly
do
this
with
liquid
white
it'll
look
a
little
bit
different
because
your
color
won't
be
as
transparent
but
it
will
certainly
certainly
work
just
scratching
a
few
little
sticks
and
twigs
here
and
there
now
then
tell
you
what
let's
take
these
big
old
trees
here
I
just
put
the
indication
of
some
bark
out
here
touch
it
sort
of
pull
it
round
give
it
a
little
round
pull
just
like
so
that's
so
same
same
same
old
mountain
colors
I'm
still
using
them
here
here
there
maybe
a
little
bright
coloring
here
with
a
light
striking
I
mean
let's
go
over
there
the
site
don't
want
these
little
trees
left
out
we'll
put
a
little
color
on
them
too
now
they'll
stand
out
against
those
dark
dark
colors
in
the
background
it's
fantastic
I
thought
you'd
like
this
and
it
it
shows
you
this
what
you
can
do
using
the
clear
can
take
a
little
little
thinner
or
you
could
use
the
liquid
clear
put
some
clear
on
the
brush
in
but
you
want
to
thin
this
paint
down
and
hearing
there
let's
just
put
a
little
sticker
tiger
whatever
there
we
go
and
then
let's
put
some
limbs
out
here
but
then
I'm
going
to
use
I'll
use
liquid
black
today
we'll
take
the
black
I'll
just
put
a
little
on
the
palate
and
let's
come
right
in
here
and
begin
drawing
in
a
few
little
branches
on
this
black
is
thin
it'll
flow
it's
liquid
black
and
just
however
many
you
want
on
your
tree
I
hope
you
can
see
that
hope
my
hands
out
nobody
don't
show
much
over
that
dark
but
we
know
they're
there
to
add
a
little
touch
of
light
to
get
them
a
pop
right
out
okay
back
over
here
in
our
big
old
tree
Oh
big
lamb
it
comes
out
through
here
like
it
wherever
you
want
them
wherever
there
comes
another
one
back
in
here
just
a
few
indicate
a
few
had
it
King
let's
take
one
dip
my
brush
into
it
a
small
amount
of
the
clear
and
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
yellow
ocher
tap
a
little
bit
of
the
bright
red
just
tap
it
can't
I
want
to
put
indication
of
some
little
leaves
out
here
come
all
in
front
of
the
tree
just
like
so
see
there
and
you
can
just
make
thousands
of
little
leaves
just
with
a
corner
of
the
big
two-inch
brush
and
you
put
them
wherever
you
on
them
that's
super
really
hope
you've
enjoyed
this
one
think
we'll
call
it
finished
see
what
you
can
do
with
a
liquid
clear
and
from
all
of
us
here
happy
painting
and
God
bless
you
you
