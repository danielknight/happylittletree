you
hello
I'm
Bob
Ross
I'd
like
to
welcome
you
to
the
10th
joy
of
painting
series
if
this
is
your
first
time
with
us
I
hope
you
grab
a
few
paints
and
some
brushes
and
come
along
and
paint
with
us
if
you've
been
with
us
before
first
of
all
I'd
like
to
thank
you
for
inviting
me
back
again
so
I
tell
you
what
let's
have
them
graphically
around
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
do
this
painting
with
me
and
they'll
come
across
in
the
same
order
that
I
have
on
the
palette
starting
with
a
titanium
white
and
working
all
the
way
around
while
they're
doing
that
let's
go
on
up
here
and
talk
a
second
this
is
an
18
by
24
canvas
this
is
a
double
Prime's
pre-stretched
canvas
and
I've
covered
it
with
a
nice
thin
even
coat
of
the
liquid
white
which
makes
it
wet
makes
it
slick
it
allows
us
to
actually
blend
color
right
here
on
the
canvas
so
we
have
it
ready
so
let's
get
together
let's
do
a
fantastic
painting
I'm
gonna
start
off
today
with
a
with
a
small
amount
of
phthalo
blue
and
we'll
just
take
it
pull
a
little
bit
out
and
then
tap
the
brush
that
assures
a
nice
even
distribution
of
color
all
the
way
through
the
brush
just
tap
it
just
tap
like
so
just
go
ahead
up
here
now
then
let's
start
right
up
in
here
and
we'll
use
little
little
crisscross
strokes
just
make
little
X's
let's
put
in
a
happy
little
cloud
little
sky
okay
a
little
more
of
the
color
this
phthalo
blue
isn't
very
pretty
bright
and
shiny
it's
a
happy
color
they're
just
continue
to
use
these
little
crisscross
strokes
and
allow
the
color
to
if
it
just
literally
blends
with
a
liquid
white
and
as
you
work
downward
here
and
you
get
all
these
fantastic
little
effects
automatically
sync
and
that
easy
that
easy
you
have
a
quick
little
sky
there
yeah
well
I
have
this
on
the
brush
tell
you
why
let's
head
least
little
Mount
of
phthalo
blue
are
they
low
green
I
mean
so
we
have
phthalo
blue
and
table
green
just
a
small
amount
of
the
greens
very
strong
let's
go
back
up
here
maybe
we'll
have
a
little
water
in
here
so
we'll
just
pull
right
across
like
this
very
gently
and
pull
from
the
outside
in
there
so
you
try
to
pull
them
from
from
the
outside
and
if
you
start
here
and
come
across
it'll
leave
a
great
big
mark
it's
very
hard
to
blend
out
we
want
to
make
this
as
easy
as
possible
but
here
all
will
do
is
just
blend
that
together
and
that
little
light
area
remains
right
here
and
it
sort
of
gives
you
gives
the
illusion
of
a
silhouette
of
light
it's
coming
across
there
just
a
little
a
little
shiny
area
okay
let's
wash
your
brush
now
if
you've
painted
with
me
before
you
know
this
is
the
fun
part
we
wash
our
brushes
with
odorless
thinner
shake
off
the
excess
just
beat
the
devil
out
of
it
alright
now
with
a
nice
clean
brush
now
we'll
go
right
back
up
here
and
we'll
just
blend
this
guy
out
a
little
bit
still
using
a
little
crisscross
strokes
now
you
can
work
this
guy
tell
us
absolutely
dead
or
you
can
leave
some
of
these
little
dark
and
light
areas
in
it
to
give
it
some
life
and
very
gently
well
blended
to
take
out
the
brushstrokes
and
right
across
the
bottom
we
have
a
happy
loose
guy
that
easy
and
easy
okay
now
then
let's
make
it
let's
make
some
big
fluffy
clouds
today
I
will
go
right
into
the
titanium
white
with
a
one-inch
brush
pick
up
the
least
little
touch
of
the
bright
red
very
small
amount
it's
very
strong
heat
up
your
whole
world
can
you
float
a
lot
of
paint
into
the
brush
this
cool
appear
down
and
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
clouds
that
just
sort
of
float
right
around
the
sky
and
have
fun
just
sort
of
mix
them
up
on
here
clouds
are
very
free
just
let
them
play
let
them
play
maybe
it
comes
right
off
in
here
and
goes
off
the
top
of
the
canvas
wherever
wherever
this
is
your
world
so
you
create
any
kind
of
illusion
that
you
want
in
your
world
there
we
go
and
these
are
just
little
floaters
little
happy
clouds
and
you
can
put
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
now
then
we'll
take
a
clean
drive
be
sure
it's
dry
two
inch
brush
and
I'm
going
to
just
gently
blend
it
using
tiny
little
circular
strokes
tiniest
little
strokes
and
just
blend
this
together
just
blending
just
sort
of
mix
it
up
then
we're
going
to
lift
it
this
sort
of
fluffs
the
cloud
just
Bluffs
it
right
up
like
so
see
then
very
lightly
there
we
go
in
that
fantastic
to
do
a
happy
little
cloud
that
easy
so
okay
shoot
we're
just
going
right
along
here
tell
you
what
I
lived
in
Alaska
oh
gosh
nearly
14
years
or
so
I
really
like
mountain
so
let's
do
a
fantastic
little
mounted
I'm
going
to
take
some
black
some
pression
blue
some
Van
Dyke
Brown
we'll
put
some
alizarin
crimson
in
there
to
be
careful
with
the
crimson
or
your
mountain
will
turn
purple
which
is
all
right
sorry
they
wrote
a
beautiful
song
about
purple
mountains
pull
it
out
very
flat
and
then
cut
across
so
you
have
a
small
roll
of
paint
right
out
of
the
edges
knife
there
you
go
go
up
here
now
that
you
have
to
make
you
have
to
make
an
almighty
decision
where's
your
mountain
to
live
I
think
he's
gonna
live
he
is
now
right
there
right
there
maybe
there's
a
bump
there
you
just
sort
of
make
a
decision
and
put
it
in
mountains
growing
all
kinds
of
shapes
and
colors
and
there
you're
restricted
only
by
your
imagination
pull
this
right
over
like
that
now
scrape
off
all
the
excess
paint
area
I'm
just
really
using
firm
pressure
pushing
that
paint
right
into
the
fabric
there
they
would
take
a
2
inch
brush
and
I
want
to
grab
it
and
pull
this
removes
excess
paint
and
blends
it
out
so
it
gets
lighter
at
the
bottom
if
you
can
see
the
entire
mountain
it's
always
lighter
at
the
bottom
than
it
is
at
the
top
because
we
have
missed
pollution
and
all
those
things
that
break
up
and
diffuse
light
see
because
this
is
wet
though
you
can
just
move
this
painter
you
can
move
it
all
over
the
canvas
this
was
a
dry
canvas
you'd
be
an
agony
city
right
now
there
we
go
let's
go
back
to
the
knife
and
let's
put
let's
put
some
snow
on
this
mountain
for
that
I'll
take
the
titanium
white
and
pull
it
out
very
flat
and
then
cut
across
to
get
that
little
roll
of
paint
again
see
there
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
now
think
where
your
lights
coming
from
you
have
to
start
making
some
big
decisions
now
if
you're
right-handed
normally
it's
easier
for
the
light
to
come
from
the
right
side
so
let's
go
right
here
touch
no
pressure
just
the
weight
of
the
knife
no
pressure
you
see
there
let
it
float
right
down
the
side
of
that
mountain
look
at
there
just
follow
the
angles
in
your
mountain
and
let
it
float
absolutely
no
pressure
no
pressure
pretend
that
if
you're
not
careful
your
hand
will
just
literally
float
away
just
float
away
very
soft
and
very
gentle
there
we
go
see
then
you
have
to
make
big
decisions
maybe
this
peak
right
here
I'll
look
here
look
here
comes
see
so
you
can
bring
it
right
in
front
you
can
move
mountains
you
can
do
anything
on
this
canvas
on
this
canvas
you
have
total
power
absolutely
and
then
let's
put
some
shadows
in
there
for
that
that
would
take
some
Hawaii
OOP
a
little
a
little
Prussian
blue
in
it
just
white
Prussian
blue
mix
it
up
to
us
about
that
color
pull
it
out
very
flat
again
cut
across
once
again
we
have
it
small
roll
of
paints
very
important
how
you
load
this
knife
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
I
want
to
touch
and
just
pull
down
now
we're
following
the
angles
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
watch
here
I
want
to
push
that
back
so
we'll
come
right
here
and
then
I'll
come
distinctly
through
see
how
it
pushes
that
peak
right
back
a
sneaky
huh
it's
easy
to
do
you
can
do
it
and
they
can
do
it
there's
no
big
secret
here
we'll
show
you
everything
that
you
need
to
paint
fantastic
paintings
there
we
go
look
at
that
see
when
you
put
those
shadows
in
there
everything
just
sort
of
pops
out
at
you
it
brings
it
alive
the
shadows
are
very
important
so
now
we
have
a
little
hunk
of
paint
right
here
that
doesn't
look
like
much
until
we
add
a
shadow
under
it
see
if
you
had
a
shadow
and
it
becomes
a
separate
entity
that
comes
a
ridge
all
by
itself
come
right
over
here
just
pulled
in
all
kinds
of
heavy
things
and
you
can
move
these
mountains
anywhere
it
you
want
them
watch
here
sometimes
it's
fun
to
just
to
play
some
games
you
can
come
right
down
in
here
and
look
there
look
at
there
there's
another
peak
that
easy
that
easy
when
you
put
the
shadow
in
here
then
it
really
becomes
a
personality
all
in
its
own
so
you
can
create
little
ridges
wherever
you
want
to
and
it's
just
a
game
of
angles
mountains
are
just
geometric
shapes
now
we
could
take
maybe
I'll
bring
this
one
distinctly
in
front
of
that
it
pushes
that
mountain
back
this
is
one
of
the
ways
that
you
create
depth
and
distance
in
your
painting
there
we
go
just
work
with
different
planes
there
we
go
okay
I
get
carried
away
sometime
I
really
like
to
paint
mountains
and
I
just
I'd
cover
up
the
whole
canvas
with
mountains
and
that's
not
bad
when
you're
learning
take
an
old
canvas
and
start
at
the
top
and
paint
all
the
way
down
over
the
mountains
and
it
just
zip
them
right
off
and
do
it
again
that's
the
way
you
learn
if
there's
a
secret
to
anything
it's
practice
just
practice
and
you
really
can
do
this
I
get
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
letters
from
people
all
over
the
country
just
like
you
and
I
and
they're
painting
beautiful
pictures
hmm
some
of
the
series
we've
showed
some
of
the
photographs
that
people
have
sent
it's
almost
unbelievable
they're
all
I'm
doing
is
tapping
and
then
lifting
upward
lifting
upward
like
that
removes
the
tap
marks
and
creates
that
nice
soft
misty
area
down
there
and
over
here
we
follow
these
angles
always
follow
the
angles
that
you've
created
in
your
mountains
see
there
and
that
NZ
we
got
a
happy
now
okay
let's
make
some
little
footy
pills
back
here
I
will
start
off
and
mix
up
some
color
I'll
just
use
this
mountain
color
and
let's
put
a
little
let's
put
some
white
with
it
and
see
what
we
have
here
so
that's
just
mainly
some
blue
and
black
and
alizarin
crimson
and
to
that
I'm
going
to
add
the
least
little
touch
least
little
touch
of
SAP
green
just
to
give
it
a
little
greenish
color
now
part
of
it
here
I'm
going
to
add
some
white
and
make
it
even
lighter
just
like
so
okay
let
me
clean
my
knife
yeah
then
let's
use
a
different
brush
today
this
is
an
oval
brush
maybe
we
can
get
a
close-up
shot
of
yet
it's
it's
a
little
different
so
it's
sort
of
round
this
is
an
oval
a
little
different
watch
here
though
I'm
going
to
fill
it
full
that
color
we
just
made
just
a
really
loaded
full
of
paint
okay
let's
go
right
up
here
now
there
you
have
to
make
a
big
decision
let's
say
a
little
footy
he'll
lives
right
here
and
all
I'm
doing
is
just
tapping
that
fantastic
look
at
all
the
little
little
things
it
makes
in
there
looks
like
just
the
tops
of
thousands
of
little
trees
for
her
off
in
the
distance
look
at
that
mmm
look
at
there
look
at
in
that
a
super
easy
way
to
make
little
footie
Hills
now
with
a
clean
dry
brush
I
want
to
create
some
mist
at
the
bases
I'm
going
to
do
is
just
half
the
base
just
the
base
down
here
don't
tap
the
top
soften
that
give
it
a
little
tiny
upward
lift
and
then
I'm
going
into
the
same
color
only
a
little
bit
darker
just
a
little
darker
load
the
brush
the
same
way
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
maybe
there's
another
little
footy
Hill
and
he
lives
right
here
about
being
a
little
darker
it
stands
out
as
things
get
closer
to
you
in
a
landscape
they
should
get
darker
value
darker
in
color
look
at
that
see
there
maybe
there
see
how
easy
that
is
painting
does
not
have
to
be
difficult
doesn't
not
have
to
be
difficult
you
don't
have
to
be
blessed
by
Michelangelo
at
Birth
to
be
able
to
paint
you
can
do
and
is
fun
there
we
go
tap
it
a
little
bit
of
mist
just
like
so
give
it
a
little
up
to
lift
and
you
can
make
layer
after
layer
after
layer
take
a
little
more
of
that
color
same
color
just
a
little
darker
watch
here
maybe
you
want
to
come
right
in
here
put
the
indication
of
another
one
there's
no
limit
but
they
need
to
get
a
little
darker
as
they
work
forward
I'm
not
careful
we'll
cover
up
the
whole
canvas
with
foothills
and
mountains
they're
that
easy
we
have
several
layers
of
foothills
and
these
different
layers
are
Plains
once
again
this
is
what
causes
a
depth
in
your
painting
and
really
really
makes
it
look
good
of
course
we're
not
interested
in
making
money
but
should
air
be
looking
for
that
happy
buck
when
you
paint
this
is
what
sells
paintings
let's
have
some
fun
here
we'll
take
some
black
Prussian
blue
SAP
green
we'll
throw
in
some
alizarin
crimson
-
what
the
heck
good
dark
color
should
look
black
I
clean
the
knife
okay
now
use
a
fan
brush
to
load
it
full
of
paint
a
lot
of
paint
both
sides
just
go
right
up
here
maybe
there's
some
little
evergreens
that
live
back
here
in
the
distance
here
I'm
just
going
to
take
and
tap
it
downward
just
a
little
trees
not
all
evergreens
maybe
there's
all
kind
of
trees
just
tap
downward
tap
it
down
now
these
are
a
little
closer
so
you're
beginning
to
see
a
little
more
detail
detail
ooh
there's
a
nice
one
so
just
tap
down
right
dot
it
makes
those
nice
little
happy
tops
up
there
and
don't
make
them
all
like
real
even
because
then
they
look
like
fence
posts
down
there
give
them
some
character
there
we
go
there
this
color
is
a
little
darker
so
it
stands
out
Alice
has
some
fun
but
as
a
traditional
painter
one
thing
that
used
to
drive
me
crazy
was
reflections
watch
here
on
a
wet
canvas
so
all
you
do
is
grab
it
and
pull
it
down
just
grab
and
pull
down
and
straight
down
where
the
trees
are
taller
pull
down
a
little
further
look
at
that
look
instant
reflections
that
fun
that's
one
of
the
things
that
works
the
best
in
this
method
of
painting
his
reflections
is
pull
it
straight
down
and
then
very
lightly
three
hairs
and
some
air
just
go
across
and
it
creates
the
illusion
of
water
and
then
take
a
little
the
liquid
height
on
the
knife
and
get
a
touch
of
the
dark
sienna
and
add
to
that
just
the
least
little
touch
there
just
to
dull
it
down
when
you
load
this
knife
take
it
cut
across
like
yet
say
cut
right
across
pull
it
out
flat
and
then
cut
across
just
go
up
here
now
then
come
straight
into
the
canvas
push
very
firmly
and
just
cut
in
a
happy
little
water
line
I
keep
this
basically
straight
you
can
go
anywhere
you
want
to
go
but
this
individual
strokes
should
be
straight
otherwise
your
water's
going
to
look
like
it's
running
right
out
of
your
painting
get
your
floor
wet
and
you're
going
to
be
upset
with
me
we
want
you
to
be
happy
there
may
be
a
little
little
ripple
here
in
there
all
kinds
of
happy
little
things
and
that
easy
and
easy
you
got
it
and
you
can
take
a
clean
fan
brush
with
at
least
a
little
bit
of
white
on
it
and
make
it
look
like
little
tree
trunks
far
away
just
by
lifting
upward
just
far
back
in
the
distance
just
just
barely
touch
and
lift
straight
up
there
just
a
few
don't
over
do
watch
the
old
brush
and
let's
have
some
fun
now
shoot
that's
Hansel
go
mix
up
a
bunch
of
dark
we'll
take
some
of
the
midnight
black
Prussian
blue
we'll
even
throw
some
Van
Dyke
Brown
in
there
alizarin
crimson
SAP
green
just
all
the
dark
colors
basically
it
doesn't
matter
make
a
big
water
paint
okay
let
me
clean
the
old
knife
off
here
and
let's
have
some
fun
let's
get
a
big
brush
and
I'm
going
to
load
this
full
of
paint
so
often
we
avoid
this
big
brush
because
of
its
size
but
the
big
brush
can
do
fantastic
things
wiggle
it
wiggle
it
that
loads
the
bristles
full
and
pull
it
that
makes
it
very
sharp
and
we're
loading
this
brush
to
a
chisel
edge
it
takes
a
lot
of
paint
in
the
brush
you
need
enough
paint
to
hold
the
bristles
together
see
how
sharp
it
is
very
good
that's
a
chisel
edge
let's
go
up
here
now
they
maybe
tell
you
on
maybe
a
happy
little
evergreen
lives
right
there
we
touch
in
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
begin
working
back
and
forth
and
we
got
to
put
some
arms
on
his
tree
gotta
give
you
some
move
a
little
arm
so
I
can
reach
up
and
gather
at
sunup
look
at
that
look
at
there
reload
your
brush
for
it
each
tree
each
tree
there
we
go
corner
and
you
sort
of
make
those
bristles
Bend
downward
hmmm
in
that
fantastic
look
at
that
and
you
can
put
as
many
or
as
few
trees
as
you
want
many
or
as
few
maybe
yeah
let's
have
a
third
one
there
we
don't
want
it
to
get
lonely
even
trees
need
a
friend
we
all
have
to
have
a
friend
so
just
put
one
right
there
okay
let's
make
some
let's
make
some
leaf
trees
to
do
that
we
pull
the
brush
through
the
paint
like
so
one
direction
pull
it
firmly
through
the
paint
and
that
rounds
one
corner
say
there
it
gives
it
sort
of
a
rounded
look
there
we
are
now
with
that
rounded
corner
toward
the
top
let's
go
right
up
here
let's
put
a
happy
tree
it
is
right
here
touch
and
give
it
a
little
push
just
bend
the
bristles
see
there
and
form
your
tree
just
like
so
it's
that
easy
so
form
your
basic
shapes
sometime
you
get
carried
away
in
this
keep
going
there
what
the
heck
we
just
push
that
little
lake
we
back
in
a
distance
what
the
heck
when
you
have
this
kind
of
power
you
can
move
Lakes
anywhere
you
want
them
we'll
put
a
happy
tree
right
here
cows
just
bring
all
that
right
on
together
they're
here
all
I'm
doing
is
putting
in
some
dark
color
we'll
come
back
and
we'll
highlight
all
these
and
that
quick
with
a
big
ol
brush
you
got
that
all
blocked
in
now
let's
put
some
take
some
dark
Sienna
the
white
pull
it
out
flat
get
that
small
roll
of
paint
like
so
okay
now
let's
go
right
up
here
and
we
just
put
two
indication
of
a
happy
little
tree
trunk
here
in
there
see
they're
that
easy
just
sort
of
touch
give
it
a
little
sideboard
pull
and
maybe
there's
some
back
in
here
we
don't
have
any
trees
living
there
take
the
point
of
the
knife
and
put
some
little
dead
sticks
and
twigs
on
there
that
easy
okay
let's
take
something
light
right
on
all
right
at
least
little
touch
you
move
into
that
like
so
cut
across
maybe
there's
a
little
tree
trunk
it
lives
right
here
see
and
you
can
put
these
everywhere
you
want
to
watch
here
you
just
take
the
knife
it's
great
then
all
kinds
of
little
things
when
this
is
all
finished
some
of
these
will
show
and
people
think
you
spill
just
days
and
days
working
with
your
little
one
here
brush
putting
them
in
don't
tell
me
different
Shh
keep
her
secret
now
let's
take
a
one
inch
brush
and
we'll
dip
it
right
into
some
of
the
liquid
white
I'll
go
into
yellow
and
reach
up
here
and
grab
some
SAP
green
so
I've
got
CAD
yellow
SAP
green
and
there's
a
little
liquid
white
on
the
brush
that
makes
the
paint
thinner
then
paint
will
stick
to
a
thick
paint
yeah
let's
put
some
leaves
on
this
this
is
what
begins
brain
this
painting
alive
and
worry
about
little
forms
here
don't
just
throw
them
on
at
random
see
make
little
little
forms
think
about
there's
all
kind
of
little
individual
limbs
living
in
there
all
right
we
can
add
some
yellow
ochre
to
that
and
put
another
happy
little
Bush
and
you
can
put
as
many
or
as
few
bushes
as
you
want
but
do
the
bush
that
you
think
is
a
father's
too
way
first
and
then
work
forward
that
way
you
have
layers
of
bushes
add
a
little
Indian
yellow
that
but
these
layers
once
again
you
get
tired
of
hearing
it
but
it's
important
these
layers
create
the
illusion
of
distance
you're
painting
here
I'm
using
the
brush
sideways
and
just
you
see
that
pushing
it
upwards
all
this
to
it
push
and
then
okay
let's
go
over
here
on
the
other
side
now
you
have
to
start
making
some
big
decisions
big
decisions
there's
trees
that
live
in
here
so
you
have
to
sort
of
pick
them
out
pull
them
out
see
that
they're
yes
here's
one
back
here
just
decide
where
trees
live
in
your
world
put
them
again
put
them
in
maybe
maybe
maybe
we'll
use
I
want
to
add
a
touch
of
the
bright
red
here
or
this'll
this'll
make
a
nice
one
don't
don't
go
too
crazy
with
this
red
a
little
it's
fireball
there's
a
mescal
color
right
in
here
we'll
have
another
little
bushed
see
what
they've
just
layered
one
after
the
other
well
I'm
after
your
lesson
looks
like
a
nice
place
to
go
fishing
now
then
I'll
add
a
little
more
SAP
green
just
bring
this
brush
to
a
nice
chiseled
edge
I'll
go
up
here
and
put
on
a
little
bit
of
highlight
onto
the
evergreens
see
don't
kill
all
your
dark
be
careful
not
to
kill
all
your
dark
areas
they're
very
important
there
okay
there
we
go
a
little
bit
on
this
streak
to
want
him
left
out
daunting
left
out
I
tell
you
what
if
you
had
a
beautiful
place
like
this
you'd
have
to
way
to
get
up
here
and
catch
a
big
trout
to
lives
there
I
know
the
trout
lives
in
there
let's
take
some
Van
Dyke
Brown
in
the
school
right
in
here
and
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
path
see
how
easy
little
path
is
to
make
there
he
goes
we
can
let
him
go
around
behind
that
tree
we
don't
know
where
it
goes
just
goes
right
on
around
there
and
hides
I
will
take
some
brown
and
so
quiet
and
then
very
lightly
barely
touch
there's
a
little
blue
in
there
too
brown
white
touch
a
blue
it
likes
gray
see
just
put
some
highlight
on
there
now
then
we
want
to
set
that
path
down
into
the
painting
let
me
get
another
1
inch
brush
here
a
little
bit
of
liquid
wine
hold
it
full
of
color
now
to
set
this
path
down
into
the
painting
watch
here
push
a
few
little
bushes
that
come
right
over
it
see
there
is
another
happy
little
Bush
and
we
just
push
that
path
right
back
look
at
there
just
disappeared
we
don't
know
where
it's
going
now
and
we
don't
care
like
so
then
we
can
take
the
knife
and
very
gently
scraping
a
few
little
sticks
and
twigs
hander
but
if
you
go
right
on
over
like
that
and
or
take
liner
brush
a
little
bit
of
paint
thinner
it
let's
sign
this
what
we
call
it
finished
I
really
hope
you've
enjoyed
this
I
thank
you
for
joining
me
today
I
look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
and
a
very
near
future
from
all
of
us
happy
painting
god
bless
you
