welcome
back
certainly
glad
to
see
you
today
you
ready
to
do
a
fantastic
little
painting
with
me
okay
tell
you
what
let's
have
them
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
while
they're
doing
that
let
me
tell
you
what
I've
already
done
up
here
I
have
my
good
ol
18
by
24
inch
canvas
here
the
top
of
it
I've
covered
with
a
thin
even
coat
of
liquid
white
then
we
have
a
piece
of
masking
tape
right
across
here
slightly
above
Center
and
in
the
bottom
of
this
canvas
is
covered
with
liquid
clear
very
small
amount
of
a
clear
down
here
thought
today
we
do
a
little
tropical
seascape
I've
had
so
many
cards
and
letters
asking
for
just
a
bright
shiny
little
seascape
thought
I'll
show
you
very
easy
and
effective
way
of
doing
one
so
let's
go
on
up
here
and
get
started
today
I'll
start
with
the
old
two-inch
brush
go
right
into
a
small
small
amount
very
small
amount
of
the
Indian
yellow
just
tap
a
little
into
the
bristles
come
right
up
here
and
we'll
just
do
something
about
like
this
I
just
let
it
go
right
on
out
without
cleaning
the
brush
I'm
gonna
add
a
small
amount
of
CAD
yellow
and
just
run
it
on
out
I
won't
have
to
clean
the
brush
it
off
and
once
again
without
cleaning
the
brush
I'm
going
to
add
yellow
ochre
and
we'll
take
that
all
the
way
up
to
the
top
just
like
so
there
we
go
now
then
still
without
cleaning
the
brush
I'm
going
to
add
just
a
touch
touch
of
the
bright
red
and
come
right
along
the
top
I'm
making
little
crisscross
sea
strokes
all
the
way
across
the
top
here
and
then
just
very
lightly
blend
that
into
the
ochre
like
so
and
here
and
there
maybe
you
can
tap
in
a
little
bit
to
make
a
little
streak
in
the
sky
wherever
you
want
maybe
maybe
maybe
yeah
right
here
we're
putting
out
wherever
just
sort
of
look
at
it
and
make
a
big
decision
there
we're
not
a
bright
shiny
little
little
sky
easy
to
do
easy
to
do
you
clean
the
brush
scrub
it
off
shake
it
and
just
beat
the
devil
out
of
habit
let's
have
some
fun
that's
Assam
fine
take
a
lizard
crimson
load
it
right
onto
the
2
inch
brush
be
right
back
right
back
don't
leave
me
and
then
we
get
a
little
bit
of
phthalo
blue
just
mix
it
right
on
the
brush
let's
go
right
up
here
underneath
here
going
to
add
a
little
bit
of
that
lavender
color
right
there
just
a
little
touch
little
touch
in
this
lavender
you
can
mix
with
the
yellow
without
a
difference
without
it
turning
green
you
know
you
have
blue
in
it
as
long
as
predominantly
crimson
you
can
mix
it
right
up
against
there
and
get
away
with
it
now
there
without
cleaning
the
brush
again
I'm
going
to
add
more
of
the
Phaedo
blue
just
a
small
amount
didn't
take
much
good
take
too
much
and
will
come
right
down
right
down
to
the
horizon
here
and
head
phthalo
blue
it's
a
very
pretty
blue
I
like
final
blue
it's
very
nice
fully
spelled
bunny
anything
very
lightly
very
lightly
just
blend
the
entire
sky
out
okay
and
we
can
wash
your
brush
one
more
time
that's
a
fun
part
of
this
whole
technique
the
camera
people
don't
think
is
so
much
fun
okay
now
then
let's
use
the
knife
today
what
the
heck
I'm
gonna
take
some
titanium
white
and
pull
it
out
as
flat
as
I
can
get
it
just
really
get
strong
pull
it
out
very
flat
go
straight
down
there
you
go
and
cut
across
you
have
a
little
roll
of
paint
okay
let's
go
up
here
this
makes
a
little
cloud
to
just
just
hang
around
here
and
have
fun
pushing
very
hard
very
hard
very
hard
just
just
lay
in
some
basic
little
cloud
chips
I
don't
want
these
to
be
bright
clouds
just
little
floaters
she
nice
little
floaters
little
fun
clouds
good
time
clouds
maybe
here's
what
comes
right
down
through
here
see
there
and
did
your
painting
you
put
them
where
ever
you
want
them
maybe
there's
a
chute
who
knows
maybe
it
is
one
that
floats
right
around
here
and
has
fun
all
day
baby
when
he
goes
right
on
off
the
edge
of
the
canvas
just
wherever
wherever
way
did
he
go
right
down
to
the
horizon
there
man
and
clean
dry
brush
and
it's
time
for
your
bravery
test
come
right
up
here
and
very
lightly
very
lightly
two
hairs
in
some
air
just
blend
those
little
clouds
barely
touching
them
barely
touching
you
take
the
brush
another
way
of
making
clouds
for
this
type
just
tap
a
little
white
into
it
and
go
up
here
and
just
literally
just
tap
it
right
onto
the
canvas
like
some
just
tap
tap
tap
tap
tap
and
maybe
right
over
here
there's
another
one
just
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
sort
of
tap
them
on
and
it
very
lightly
very
lightly
just
blend
them
and
that's
a
super
easy
way
of
making
some
cute
little
clouds
okay
one
more
time
now
then
let's
take
the
tape
off
and
you'll
see
you
have
a
perfectly
straight
horizon
that's
one
of
the
nicest
easiest
little
ways
of
getting
a
Street
horizon
I've
ever
seen
when
you're
doing
a
seascape
now
then
I'm
a
mix
up
let's
take
some
halo
blue
and
alizarin
crimson
mix
it
together
that's
very
difficult
very
difficult
to
tell
what
color
that
is
it
just
looks
black
if
you
want
to
find
out
reach
over
here
and
get
a
little
white
and
mix
it
in
there
and
see
what
you
have
if
it's
a
color
you
like
super
if
it's
not
this
is
a
time
to
change
it
this
is
the
time
now
one
of
the
things
when
you're
doing
a
seascape
if
you'll
sort
of
figure
out
basically
where
you
want
the
major
wave
to
be
in
here
it'll
save
you
a
lot
of
problems
so
let's
say
our
major
wave
it's
going
to
live
right
there
and
just
sort
of
take
the
filbert
brush
and
just
sketch
out
a
basic
shape
of
where
you
want
that
rascal
to
live
like
so
it's
going
to
curl
over
like
that
once
you
have
that
in
then
you
can
lay
it
all
out
let's
just
use
the
old
2
inch
brush
shoot
that's
tap
a
little
this
dark
lavender
color
in
here
let's
go
right
up
here
and
let's
just
begin
putting
in
some
color
like
so
all
right
so
I'll
just
let
it
come
right
along
that
horizon
there
just
fry
it
along
okay
and
you
come
right
down
to
this
major
wave
it
really
doesn't
matter
if
you
get
it
up
it's
just
a
guy
it's
calling
the
guy
and
I
think
you'll
find
that
it
really
helps
you
to
put
that
in
though
now
I'm
going
to
add
a
little
touch
of
phthalo
blue
to
that
same
color
and
I'll
just
I'll
just
use
the
brush
to
sort
of
mix
them
together
so
I'll
put
a
little
more
blue
into
it
and
with
that
we'll
go
out
to
the
edges
here
want
the
edges
to
be
a
little
bit
a
little
bit
more
to
the
blue
tone
and
just
fill
this
in
and
same
thing
over
here
on
the
other
side
just
fill
it
in
right
up
to
that
alright
that
quick
you
have
the
whole
back
you
seascape
done
same
old
brush
still
hadn't
cleaned
it
I
want
to
use
the
black
and
touch
it
a
little
blue
once
again
just
mix
them
on
the
brush
and
let's
go
right
up
in
here
do
that
let's
put
a
little
color
in
see
because
the
liquid
clear
is
on
the
canvas
the
color
stays
true
if
you
have
liquid
white
on
the
canvas
you
did
this
it
would
dilute
the
color
with
a
liquid
clear
if
you
don't
have
that
problem
there
we
go
but
I
can't
tell
you
enough
to
use
just
a
small
small
amount
it
it
goes
a
long
way
one
container
of
clear
should
last
you
for
years
there
we
go
right
up
on
the
other
side
back
over
here
see
there
shoot
you
get
to
seascape
half-painted
already
that
easy
alright
well
we
have
a
little
brush
going
we
might
as
well
this
waves
gonna
be
curling
over
so
we
can
add
some
dark
colors
now
if
you're
uncomfortable
using
a
brush
this
big
and
do
these
things
use
your
smaller
brush
either
one
will
work
there
we
go
let
me
just
put
that
in
alright
I
have
several
brushes
going
here
so
let
me
grab
another
one
I
want
take
a
little
dark
Sienna
we
just
put
it
out
here
a
little
dark
Sienna
I'm
gonna
grab
some
yellow
ochre
yellow
ochre
reach
up
here
get
some
white
so
I
got
dark
Sienna
yellow
and
white
there
just
tap
it
into
the
bristles
let's
go
right
in
here
maybe
there'd
be
a
little
beach
it
lives
right
here
right
there
and
just
let
that
blend
right
up
into
the
to
the
water
color
here
there
we
go
just
let
it
slam
together
like
so
okay
we
have
the
entire
canvas
block
down
now
now
we
can
begin
getting
serious
about
it
okay
we'll
start
with
a
with
a
knife
take
a
little
bit
of
the
titanium
white
pull
it
out
very
flat
just
as
flat
as
you
can
get
it
and
take
the
knife
and
cut
across
and
get
that
little
roll
of
paint
always
loading
the
knife
for
that
little
roll
of
paint
and
let's
begin
making
some
little
waves
at
a
far
far
back
here
in
the
distance
early
I
really
can't
see
them
they're
just
little
teeny
ones
so
use
a
firm
pressure
and
push
just
push
firm
pressure
though
really
the
knife
is
literally
bending
literally
bending
just
put
some
little
sparklers
here
here
just
here
in
there
and
when
you
push
that
hard
with
a
knife
is
little
ridges
of
paint
here
and
little
ridges
of
paint
we'll
use
those
later
on
that's
where
we'll
place
our
highlights
along
Oh
a
little
sparklers
but
I'm
putting
a
tremendous
amount
of
pressure
here
really
getting
strong
take
out
all
yet
oh
your
frustrations
this
way
there
and
right
I
don't
over
maybe
a
couple
of
little
doors
right
in
here
wherever
you
want
up
this
is
just
sort
of
an
individual
thing
okay
now
we
can
even
take
a
little
that
white
and
push
it
right
on
top
of
that
I
hand
up
here
on
top
now
there
I'll
use
a
little
touch
we'll
just
use
that
same
color
that
we
use
to
make
sand
to
that'll
add
a
little
bit
more
yellow
ochre
make
it
a
little
brighter
and
white
so
it's
quite
bright
pull
it
out
cut
across
get
the
teeny
little
roll
of
paint
tiny
little
bit
of
paint
and
let's
just
go
up
here
and
just
very
gently
just
letting
graze
those
higher
points
just
let
it
grease
don't
want
a
great
deal
of
paint
just
barely
barely
grazing
just
caress
it
just
caress
it
just
touch
barely
barely
touch
Jane
I'm
going
to
take
titanium
white
and
the
least
little
bit
of
yellow
at
the
CAD
yellow
titanium
white
and
a
little
tiny
bit
of
CAD
yellow
tiniest
little
bit
and
once
again
pull
it
out
flat
cut
across
and
we
have
a
tiniest
little
roll
of
paint
out
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
okay
now
then
with
this
we
can
really
Sparkle
decide
where
the
lights
striking
the
water
and
that's
where
you
put
your
bright
spots
barely
touching
barely
touching
okay
and
I
ever
menu
on
or
a
few
there
we
go
okay
now
I'll
have
that
cutter
on
there
I
want
to
add
a
little
bit
right
there
that
easy
maybe
even
back
in
here
just
put
a
little
bit
right
in
there
Jane
had
let
me
find
a
fan
brush
here
I'll
take
a
little
titanium
white
on
my
fan
brush
and
let's
put
a
another
wave
Jim
he
lives
right
here
comes
right
down
gotta
make
those
little
wave
noises
yeah
bit
of
white
right
there
maybe
this
one
just
progresses
on
that
we
don't
know
where
it
goes
now
then
very
gently
grab
that
and
just
sort
of
blend
it
back
just
blend
it
back
and
it
makes
the
trough
in
between
the
leaves
just
gently
blend
it
back
now
tell
you
I
don't
show
you
something
here
yeah
little
little
bit
of
that
yellow
I
won't
put
a
little
that
bright
yellow
right
here
and
maybe
right
here
just
a
little
bit
on
that'll
bit
on
and
will
take
that
fan
brush
wipe
off
the
paint
and
grab
that
yellow
and
blend
it
back
so
it
looks
like
is
there's
the
sunlight
just
laying
in
between
there
playing
having
fun
there
now
then
this
back
mmm
it's
how
bright
and
shiny
that
is
where
the
lights
really
striking
right
along
there
and
it
gets
darker
darker
darker
as
it
works
away
okay
then
right
above
this
way
you
hear
just
blend
that
light
in
there
mmm
that's
pretty
just
a
bright
little
rascal
okay
you
know
take
a
little
white
least
least
little
touch
if
they
low
blue
on
the
fan
brush
white
a
little
touch
it
they
look
blue
and
let's
go
right
up
in
here
and
you
could
just
come
back
in
here
and
add
in
a
little
touches
of
color
just
turn
your
white
a
little
bit
of
hope
it
shows
up
enough
so
you
see
it
there
here
and
there
there
we
go
just
sort
of
drop
those
in
wherever
you
want
okay
right
over
there
in
here
and
everywhere
you're
always
using
this
little
rocking
motion
just
little
guess
that's
a
good
word
for
a
little
rocking
motion
it
helps
create
the
illusion
of
all
kinds
of
little
waves
and
stuff
happening
without
actually
doing
the
whole
bunch
there
there
that
flew
just
shining
right
through
this
bright
spot
there
okay
time
to
have
some
fun
let's
do
the
I
of
the
wave
that's
always
what
everybody
wants
to
wants
to
do
that's
the
fun
part
take
the
filbert
brush
a
little
touch
of
the
CAD
yellow
and
white
a
little
lot
of
paint
on
the
brush
and
let's
go
up
here
and
get
tough
with
it
just
get
in
here
and
scrub
it
hard
just
really
scrub
it
scrub
it
and
then
begin
working
out
that's
another
reason
we
do
this
sketch
because
you
don't
want
paint
in
here
you
want
to
keep
that
pure
now
that
again
working
outward
outward
outward
our
and
automatically
you'll
get
darker
and
darker
as
you
run
out
of
paint
there
again
shaping
and
forming
the
wave
darker
darker
darker
right
on
out
to
nothing
now
then
clean
dry
be
sure
it's
dry
two-inch
brush
and
use
just
the
corner
and
all
we're
going
to
do
here
is
just
stir
it
up
mix
it
up
Tiny's
little
circles
tiny
little
circles
you
can
blend
this
to
us
as
smooth
as
glass
now
let's
begin
shaping
our
wave
grab
it
and
pull
see
grab
and
pull
and
that
neat
that
easy
you
can
create
the
shape
of
this
way
and
it
easy
anything
there
it
is
okay
let
me
find
a
fan
brush
I
have
several
fan
brushes
going
also
I'll
take
a
little
that
height
has
a
least
little
touch
of
yellow
in
it
now
then
let's
do
this
big
crashing
wave
here
grab
it
and
pull
like
the
little
noises
and
it'll
pay
you
to
wipe
your
brush
between
each
stroke
and
reload
it
so
you
get
nice
clean
color
there
this
is
the
this
is
the
part
of
the
painting
that
everybody
wants
to
see
and
if
you're
out
if
you're
out
selling
paintings
of
course
not
I
was
interested
in
that
happy
but
but
if
you're
out
selling
paint
is
this
is
the
part
that
sells
okay
use
the
old
filbert
brush
here
and
I'm
going
to
load
a
touch
just
a
touch
of
this
lavender
color
we
had
on
the
brush
okay
let's
go
up
in
here
now
then
let's
put
some
foam
we'll
put
the
shadow
in
first
put
the
shadow
in
there
we
go
and
all
we're
doing
is
just
scrubbing
it
in
put
the
shadow
in
put
the
shadow
it
let
it
just
come
around
this
is
where
you
begin
shaping
your
wave
right
there
there's
a
let
this
shadow
just
wherever
you
want
it
here
it
comes
big
splashing
thing
very
counsel
but
the
shadow
first
though
okay
wash
your
brush
then
wipe
it
on
a
paper
towel
be
sure
it's
as
dry
as
you
can
get
it
okay
now
let's
go
right
back
into
her
this
is
our
mixture
of
a
titanium
white
or
the
least
little
touch
of
yellow
in
it
load
a
lot
of
color
into
the
bristles
now
then
just
sort
of
give
it
upward
push
and
put
the
highlight
right
up
on
top
right
up
on
top
of
all
it
turn
the
brush
use
both
sides
now
when
it
runs
out
of
paint
wipe
it
off
good
yet
all
that's
blue
and
lavender
color
off
of
it
come
back
with
your
nice
color
see
make
those
little
noises
really
helps
to
get
you
in
the
mood
and
I
just
sort
of
bring
it
all
together
there
okay
now
then
with
our
clean
dry
two
inch
brush
once
again
I
just
got
just
grabbing
this
and
going
to
stir
it
up
tiniest
little
circular
strokes
blend
that
right
into
the
shadow
except
the
very
edge
you
don't
want
to
blend
that
edge
you
want
save
it
just
blend
it
blend
it
blend
it
now
you
could
use
the
one-inch
brush
for
this
but
the
two
inch
brush
I
like
to
use
it
seems
to
have
more
hair
there
really
seems
to
work
a
lot
nicer
we
can
put
a
little
touch
that
highlight
color
over
here
and
the
other
side
of
that
wave
pull
it
down
so
it
looks
like
it
continues
okay
let
me
find
my
little
liner
brush
take
the
liner
brush
and
we
go
into
some
titanium
white
the
least
little
touch
if
they
look
blue
in
it
now
let's
just
take
this
come
right
along
here
and
begin
adding
some
highlights
here
and
there
just
like
so
now
at
home
you
have
unlimited
time
and
you
can
just
put
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
things
like
this
here
you
know
they
had
no
sense
here
we're
shoot
if
I
go
over
30
minutes
they
get
upset
and
start
yelling
at
me
there
we
go
but
these
little
things
these
little
things
help
shape
and
form
your
waves
all
kinds
of
little
little
glitters
here
fan
brush
also
works
very
nice
take
a
fan
brush
a
little
touch
it
a
little
blue
and
white
and
begin
putting
just
all
kinds
of
little
little
foam
patterns
that
are
moving
and
playing
but
this
is
how
you
once
again
where
you
create
the
shape
of
your
wave
as
it
goes
out
is
getting
flatter
and
flatter
there
maybe
tell
you
huh
any
what
right
out
here
oops
there
we
go
and
we
come
again
let's
just
lay
in
a
bit
of
foam
that's
laying
down
here
this
is
just
titanium
white
but
it's
picking
up
all
those
little
colors
that
are
underneath
leave
some
openings
leave
some
holes
in
it
so
you
can
see
that
sand
and
the
water
all
through
it
pull
like
it
still
making
a
little
rocking
type
strokes
travels
right
on
up
the
wave
now
right
underneath
this
wave
here
it's
going
to
be
a
little
darker
because
it's
a
shadow
created
by
that
wave
so
brighter
out
here
and
lighter
there
okay
now
then
scrip
liner
brush
a
little
bit
of
the
lavender
and
we
need
to
have
a
little
dark
line
that
lives
right
into
this
it
will
pop
that
right
up
right
up
and
you
can
come
back
in
here
but
just
all
kinds
of
little
things
wherever
you
want
to
tell
you
what
this
is
going
to
be
a
tropical
scene
we
need
a
happy
little
palm
tree
in
there
shoot
an
easy
way
of
making
no
indication
of
a
palm
tree
will
just
use
Van
Dyck
Brown
on
the
fan
brush
a
little
bit
full
of
color
let's
go
right
up
here
decide
where
your
palm
tree
lives
maybe
this
palm
tree
maybe
lives
right
here
goes
right
off
the
canvas
we
don't
know
exactly
where
it
goes
let's
give
him
a
friend
we
want
to
get
lonely
you
right
through
the
crasher
there
then
we
get
two
palm
trees
pretty
soon
and
you
know
how
palm
trees
are
pretty
soon
to
be
three
now
then
now
then
take
a
little
black-and-white
like
sort
of
a
grayish
color
here
and
with
that
let's
just
just
put
a
little
light
on
this
just
a
little
light
like
so
right
up
the
old
tree
so
dududu
there
okay
you
can
take
you
can
take
the
liner
brush
with
a
little
dark
color
on
it
and
really
work
it
make
it
a
little
little
doers
like
it
go
on
are
all
the
way
up
a
tree
he
fan
brush
let's
make
some
big
leaves
out
there
dip
the
fan
brush
into
paint
thinner
I'm
going
to
take
black
move
and
get
it
thin
thin
like
water
like
ink
a
lot
of
thinner
in
there
it's
very
thin
it'll
run
on
you
okay
and
then
let's
come
out
up
in
here
decide
where
you
big
palm
leaves
maybe
this
one
comes
right
around
June
now
because
this
is
so
wet
and
thin
can
grab
it
look
at
that
see
there
and
that
easy
you
can
make
all
those
beautiful
little
shapes
now
that's
just
wherever
you
want
to
think
about
how
your
palm
tree
going
to
look
sometimes
you
can
see
both
sides
sometimes
one
side
there
is
why
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
ways
I've
ever
seen
to
make
a
striking
little
palm
tree
and
this
black
color
against
that
bright
background
oh
really
really
stands
out
you'll
like
that
then
what
do
I
sell
going
to
get
left
out
will
give
him
a
nice
limb
to
grab
it
pop
it
tuned
here
comes
another
one
it
goes
right
out
through
there
grab
it
give
it
a
cool
another
one
and
maybe
one
right
here
just
however
many
and
a
little
one
see
there
that's
one
of
the
nicest
ways
there
is
to
make
a
little
palm
tree
I
hope
you've
enjoyed
this
little
tropical
sunset
type
scene
and
I
look
forward
to
painting
with
you
again
until
then
happy
painting
and
God
bless
you
you
you
