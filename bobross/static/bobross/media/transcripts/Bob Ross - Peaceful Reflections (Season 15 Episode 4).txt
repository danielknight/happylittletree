hi
I'm
glad
you
could
join
me
today

we're
going
to
do
a
wonderful
little
painting
and
I
really
think
you're
gonna
I
think
you're
going
to
enjoy
this
once
I
tell
you
what
let's
don't
waste
any
time
let's
have
Myrtle
ugly
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
me
I've
got
mold
18
but
24
inch
canvas
up
here
it's
all
covered
with
a
nice
thin
even
coat
of
the
liquid
white
it's
wet
slick
it's
ready
to
go
so
let's
just
do
what
I
thought
today
let's
do
maybe
a
little
traditional
painting
with
some
mountains
and
and
pretty
sky
and
maybe
some
water
and
who
knows
let's
just
let's
just
do
stuff
and
have
a
good
time
start
off
with
the
old
two
inch
brush
today
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
a
small
this
little
amount
of
the
Indian
yellow
just
just
a
little
color
doesn't
take
my
town
put
a
little
yellowish
glow
in
the
sky
now
the
Indian
yellow
is
quite
transparent
there
I'm
in
a
bright
happy
mood
today
it's
a
good
day
to
be
alive
so
let's
do
a
painting
that
reflects
that
shoot
every
day
is
a
good
day
to
be
alive
there
we
are
maybe
a
little
bit
of
it
down
here
what
we're
going
to
have
water
we
just
put
a
little
in
there
what
day
okay
without
even
cleaning
the
brush
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
a
touch
of
alizarin
crimson
it
just
just
tap
a
little
bit
into
the
bristles
like
so
like
so
I
will
go
right
up
above
this
and
I
just
gonna
lay
in
a
little
bit
of
crimson
just
wherever
sorry
let
them
flow
together
there
we
are
let's
blend
those
edges
out
very
nice
just
put
a
little
warm
spot
up
here
in
the
sky
okay
it
would
take
a
little
crimson
and
we'll
throw
a
little
of
that
down
I
heard
-
what
the
heck
what
that
we
don't
care
that's
good
enough
okay
just
have
a
good
time
that's
really
what
paintings
all
about
is
just
enjoy
yourself
okay
little
phthalo
blue
and
I
still
had
the
same
old
dirty
brush
let's
go
right
on
back
up
in
here
using
a
little
crisscross
strokes
and
I've
started
out
here
working
downward
so
it'll
mix
with
a
liquid
white
and
automatic
didn't
get
lighter
and
lighter
and
value
there
see
the
blue
is
so
much
stronger
than
that
crimson
Widow
just
it'll
eat
it
up
if
you're
not
careful
maybe
a
little
bit
right
in
here
that
way
you
do
your
painting
if
you
don't
want
all
these
colors
in
the
sky
just
leave
them
out
you
can
make
any
canvas
guy
that
you
want
just
want
to
show
you
how
to
make
a
beautiful
bright
little
painting
we'll
take
some
phthalo
blue
and
a
touch
just
a
touch
of
phthalo
green
phthalo
blue
and
phthalo
green
and
let's
put
some
let's
put
some
water
down
here
there
pull
from
the
outside
yeah
outside
yeah
a
little
bit
on
the
other
side
there
we
go
just
let
all
these
colors
just
sort
of
blend
in
together
don't
want
to
kill
all
that
bright
spot
right
there
it'll
go
away
and
leave
you
yeah
it'll
go
away
and
leave
you
there
okay
and
now
we
can
wash
your
brush
we
put
all
this
color
on
there
and
this
is
the
first
time
we've
washed
our
brush
use
odorless
thinner
shake
off
the
excess
and
there
we
go
now
that
I
want
to
blend
the
sky
out
be
sure
your
brush
is
good
clean
and
dry
start
in
the
light
area
and
the
light
area
and
blend
outward
always
blending
outward
up
try
not
to
bring
that
blue
color
back
into
that
yellow
or
you'll
have
a
bright
green
sky
unless
that's
what
you
want
okay
Nannan
just
not
good
excess
paint
off
my
brush
and
continue
to
blend
there
we
go
okay
one
more
time
now
you
can
blend
this
till
it's
very
soft
and
very
delicate
you
can't
tell
where
one
color
stops
and
the
next
color
starts
and
sometimes
when
you're
painting
at
home
step
back
from
your
painting
and
take
a
look
see
it's
hard
to
see
you
when
you're
very
close
step
back
and
look
at
it
and
you'll
see
a
whole
new
perspective
things
are
look
totally
different
there
all
right
down
here
it
is
very
lightly
Jess
go
across
is
mixing
with
a
liquid
white
and
it
all
just
sort
of
blends
together
that's
pretty
already
that's
pretty
mmm
okay
okay
Pleakley
no
brush
one
more
time
shake
it
up
cover
hold
the
camera
people
we
go
let's
put
us
a
little
mountain
up
here
for
that
Oh
moon
use
use
a
midnight
black
some
Van
Dyke
Brown
alizarin
crimson
a
little
Prussian
blue
cut
dark
color
mix
it
up
pull
it
out
very
flat
cut
off
her
a
little
roll
of
paint
right
there
now
then
you
got
to
make
your
first
big
major
decision
where's
your
Mountain
live
in
your
world
maybe
maybe
your
mountain
lives
right
there
well
it
sure
does
now
firmly
push
that
right
into
the
fabric
just
a
really
push
like
so
use
a
lot
of
pressure
how'd
it
go
off
over
here
somewhere
whatever
scrape
off
all
the
excess
paint
take
a
2
inch
brush
and
we
grab
that
once
again
the
canvas
is
wet
we
can
move
color
we
can
absolutely
move
color
if
you're
on
a
dry
canvas
and
you
try
to
pull
this
paint
you're
gonna
be
an
agony
city
that's
one
of
the
reasons
that
I
stress
so
much
that
we
use
a
pre
stretch
to
double
prime
canvas
if
you
use
a
canvas
board
or
canvas
paper
it
will
absorb
your
liquid
white
and
you'll
be
left
with
a
dry
surface
and
we
depend
on
this
being
wet
through
the
entire
painting
there
we
go
banana
let's
put
some
let's
put
some
snow
on
that
mountain
we
take
some
white
I'll
take
the
least
little
touch
of
alizarin
crimson
put
in
there
just
to
warm
it
up
the
least
least
little
amount
don't
want
to
set
it
on
fire
pull
it
out
very
flat
get
strong
with
it
very
flat
go
straight
down
cut
off
our
little
roll
of
paint
hmm
now
then
you
have
to
make
some
big
decisions
in
my
world
I
think
the
lights
going
to
be
coming
from
the
right
and
you're
going
to
find
if
you're
right-handed
it's
normally
easier
for
the
light
to
come
from
the
right
if
you're
left-handed
it
will
vary
from
person
to
person
I
have
a
brother
who's
left-handed
and
I
know
left-handed
people
their
entire
life
are
forced
to
do
right-handed
things
so
some
left-handed
people
will
find
it
easier
to
highlight
on
the
left
some
on
the
right
but
most
right-handed
people
99
out
of
100
will
find
it
easier
to
highlight
on
the
right
try
it
a
little
bit
see
what
works
for
you
there
okay
what
I
was
when
I
was
teaching
for
a
living
all
the
time
one
of
the
things
that
I
found
when
teaching
a
person
who
is
left-handed
it's
super
nice
if
you
have
a
big
mirror
if
you
have
a
mirror
you
can
do
it
and
it
looks
correct
then
to
a
left-handed
person
there
I
can
take
a
little
blue
little
white
assist
they
look
blue
and
white
there
I've
got
flat
once
again
our
little
roll
of
paint
just
like
so
now
then
let's
just
put
the
indication
of
a
shadow
now
let's
push
this
one
back
watch
right
here
you
come
right
down
through
here
and
distinctly
come
through
that
sleeve
and
it
pushes
that
little
thing
right
on
back
into
the
background
that
easy
you
have
the
power
to
move
mountains
there
just
put
in
a
few
little
shadows
here
and
there
there
push
that
one
right
on
back
bring
that
together
maybe
there's
a
little
shadow
hides
right
in
there
see
anywhere
you
want
a
little
indentation
in
your
mountain
put
a
shadow
there
it's
all
it
takes
watch
here
clean
dry
brush
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
of
mist
down
here
at
the
base
so
gently
tapping
following
the
angles
and
lift
upward
upward
upward
upward
very
gentle
though
very
very
gentle
all
you're
doing
here
is
caressing
the
canvas
that's
barely
touching
now
sometimes
it's
fun
to
come
back
and
change
your
Mountain
watching
here
see
maybe
you
want
to
bring
this
back
out
a
little
doer
in
there
and
your
world
you
could
do
anything
that
you
want
to
do
there
we
are
see
maybe
there's
a
comes
right
out
through
here
I
don't
know
wherever
you
wanna
just
sort
of
make
a
decision
in
your
mind
and
drop
it
in
just
practicing
things
in
your
mind
and
then
putting
them
on
canvas
there
sing
babban
our
little
shadow
back
here
maybe
here
and
there
a
little
shadow
shoot
you've
got
one
fantastic
mountain
there
we
are
okay
head
over
here
always
following
the
angles
that
you
have
in
your
mountain
there
we
go
nigga
just
blend
all
that
together
time
to
have
some
fun
let's
make
us
up
a
mixture
of
dark
color
here
we'll
use
some
black
Prussian
blue
shootout
throw
some
play-doh
green
in
there
too
it
doesn't
matter
a
little
bit
of
crimson
the
brown
whatever
you
get
you're
just
looking
mainly
for
a
good
dark
color
it
should
look
black
let
me
clean
my
knife
hmm
okay
and
we'll
take
an
old
fan
brush
let's
load
it
full
of
color
a
lot
of
paper
both
sides
full
okay
and
maybe
back
in
here
in
our
world
there
lives
a
lot
of
little
distant
trees
and
all
you're
doing
is
tapping
down
over
the
fan
brush
just
tap
it
down
now
so
I
want
to
get
progressively
smaller
when
when
this
is
done
that
will
help
lead
the
eye
around
the
corner
corn
down
straight
we
don't
know
where
it
goes
but
wherever
it
goes
it's
a
happy
little
place
back
here
okay
maybe
maybe
here
and
there
in
our
world
maybe
one
or
two
these
trees
--is
though
a
little
more
distinct
stands
out
a
little
stronger
you
see
a
little
more
detail
lot
of
paint
though
there's
one
just
sort
of
working
back
and
forth
and
you
just
put
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
now
right
in
here
let's
have
some
reflections
because
this
is
wet
the
paint
will
move
use
two
nice
traditional
painter
reflections
were
hard
to
do
I
turn
the
canvas
upside
down
and
paint
the
scene
over
but
watch
right
here
because
this
is
wet
all
you
have
to
do
is
grab
it
and
pull
it
straight
down
straight
down
like
so
see
there
straight
down
and
then
very
lightly
come
across
didn't
it
fantastic
see
how
you
can
move
those
and
push
them
pull
them
wiggle
them
bend
them
whatever
you
want
to
do
with
them
they're
yours
and
you
can
do
anything
anything
take
a
little
liquid
white
to
that
I'm
going
to
add
the
least
little
touch
of
blue
tiniest
little
bit
of
halo
blue
not
much
done
can't
hardly
even
tell
is
any
blue
in
there
let's
just
put
a
little
do
that
again
pull
a
little
color
like
that
on
the
knife
and
push
firmly
I'm
really
pushing
very
firmly
here
very
firmly
there
we
go
now
we
can
take
our
knife
just
a
clean
knife
scrape
through
here
and
there
indication
of
some
sticks
twigs
tree
trunks
all
those
happy
little
things
yeah
let's
bill
some
more
trees
this
will
be
our
evergreen
painting
we'll
have
a
lot
of
evergreens
in
this
one
so
let's
come
right
up
here
we'll
put
a
happy
little
evergreen
right
there
back
and
forth
there
just
go
back
and
forth
a
little
a
little
subtler
guys
just
live
right
in
it
Bryce
you
gonna
push
him
out
sometime
I
lived
in
Alaska
for
so
many
years
and
I
love
these
scenes
with
mountains
and
evergreens
looks
like
home
to
me
there
we
go
even
if
you're
into
selling
paintings
these
type
scene
where
they
sell
like
hotcakes
hey
everybody
likes
I
must
come
right
over
here
maybe
there's
a
little
tree
where's
earlier
I
don't
know
wherever
you
want
got
a
friend
right
there
this
Clyde
he
lives
there
and
we
just
push
up
see
what
that
easy
we
can
make
a
little
peninsula
that
comes
right
out
see
how
that
pushes
everything
back
drop
some
of
it
underneath
take
our
big
brush
grab
that
give
it
a
little
downward
pull
so
we
have
some
instant
reflections
hmm
sneaky
huh
shoot
I'm
gonna
make
a
big
evergreen
home
a
big
one
this
one
is
taller
than
the
mountain
he
goes
we
appear
in
the
sky
it's
a
granddaddy
evergreen
Alaska
I
used
to
have
a
huge
huge
evergreen
that
lived
in
my
front
yard
boy
he
was
a
son
of
a
gun
look
like
he
is
a
hundred
foot
tall
and
the
ptarmigan
used
to
come
in
every
afternoon
and
it
set
in
that
tree
ptarmigan
ur
beautiful
grouse
type
bird
it
lives
in
Alaska
it's
not
too
smart
though
they're
sort
of
like
oh
I
don't
know
they
taste
sort
of
like
pheasant
and
the
people
eat
them
there
and
that
good
eatin
from
what
I
understand
diamond
I
wasn't
much
of
a
hunter
should
I
Bret
didn't
feed
them
they
were
safe
at
my
house
a
little
bit
of
the
liquid
white
we
just
run
that
right
around
like
so
can
you
find
here's
a
good
old
brush
just
take
a
2
inch
brush
we'll
pull
it
right
through
some
color
so
you
pull
it
in
one
direction
through
the
color
a
lot
of
paint's
loaded
into
those
bristles
a
lot
of
paint
okay
now
that
may
be
right
in
here
lives
some
bushes
and
all
kind
of
happy
little
things
right
there
and
we
can
reflect
some
of
that
right
into
the
water
into
the
water
that
easy
and
on
the
other
side
one
was
just
happy
little
bushes
trees
parentsí
just
make
this
look
like
a
little
yd
maybe
just
a
little
River
they
just
wander
add
on
back
in
there
goes
out
behind
the
bin
it's
super
place
to
take
a
canoe
it
just
sort
of
float
down
the
river
six
okay
take
some
dark
sienna
a
little
bit
of
white
mix
it
up
so
it
sort
of
Marbley
cut
me
off
a
little
roll
of
paint
and
we'll
go
right
up
here
enter
that
I'm
just
gonna
put
the
indication
here
and
there
of
a
few
tree
trunks
there
and
this
big
old
tree
he
needs
a
he
needs
a
trunk
too
big
trunk
in
here
give
it
a
little
sad
words
pull
okay
I'll
grab
another
fan
brush
I
have
several
of
them
going
here
so
I
don't
have
to
spend
all
my
time
cleaning
brushes
well
it
takes
a
matte
dark
color
we've
made
the
evergreens
out
of
mix
it
with
a
little
yellow
and
automatically
that's
gonna
turn
a
beautiful
green
because
it
has
blue
in
it
or
black
I'll
scoop
here
now
then
let's
put
some
highlights
on
these
trees
the
mountain
says
our
lights
coming
from
the
right
so
it
also
strike
the
trees
stronger
on
the
right
than
it
would
on
the
left
there
we
go
hmm
I
like
to
keep
these
evergreens
quite
dark
quite
dark
it
adds
contrast
to
your
paintings
go
over
here
in
this
big
wind
look
at
there
and
that's
super
to
see
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
little
leaves
and
twigs
that
easy
and
you
can
take
just
a
clean
knife
evergreens
always
have
dead
sticks
hanging
off
of
them
watch
out
coming
up
here
watch
you
take
it
see
it
just
pop
in
a
few
little
dead
sticks
and
twigs
hang
around
off
your
tree
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
scrape
scrape
right
through
the
paint
just
scrape
through
the
paint
I
don't
want
to
injure
precious
clean
dip
it
into
a
little
bit
of
the
liquid
white
and
then
into
some
color
we're
gonna
take
some
SAP
green
CAD
yellow
then
we'll
sort
of
bounce
back
and
forth
into
who
gets
the
deal
ochre
in
a
minute
let's
go
right
up
here
there's
a
happy
little
Bush
I
remember
he
lives
right
here
right
there
beautiful
little
bush
and
he
shines
in
the
Sun
okay
nothin
watch
right
here
let's
turn
that
into
reflections
just
by
pulling
it
down
go
lightly
cross
saw
there's
to
it
yeah
I'm
going
to
yellow
ocher
the
lady
in
yellow
here
and
they're
here
lives
another
little
bush
see
you
just
sort
of
visualize
these
in
your
mind
and
drop
them
in
drop
them
yet
there
we
are
maybe
right
here
there's
another
little
bush
but
sea-doo
layer
after
layer
after
layer
one
bush
at
a
time
drop
it
in
and
then
work
forward
okay
you
and
then
reflect
a
little
bit
of
that
right
into
the
water
here
you
know
one
of
the
questions
I'd
probably
get
half
a
dozen
letters
a
week
asking
if
we
do
any
tracings
or
any
video
editing
when
we're
making
these
shows
and
I
really
I've
mentioned
this
before
but
there's
there's
absolutely
no
video
magic
that
happens
here
what
what
happens
here
good
or
bad
absolutely
happens
in
the
time
that
you
see
it
happen
there
pull
straight
down
and
go
lightly
across
okay
yeah
if
I
was
to
do
something
that
you
didn't
see
I'd
feel
like
I
was
cheating
yet
tell
you
what
do
we
get
my
fan
brush
here
get
a
little
bit
of
color
right
on
the
fan
brush
maybe
back
here
in
the
distance
but
the
indication
of
a
little
huh
a
little
grassy
area
we
back
in
there
like
so
seeing
that
pushes
that
one
we
back
now
watch
here
and
we
put
a
bush
here
that's
really
gonna
be
the
separator
now
it
becomes
a
separate
entity
if
as
far
away
that
may
be
right
here
live
Skipton
you're
right
a
happy
little
Bush
but
they
should
be
a
nice
place
to
live
out
here
it's
so
pretty
looks
peaceful
nobody's
angry
out
here
oh
this
is
a
nice
spot
to
sit
out
here
watch
the
animals
talk
to
trees
make
friends
with
God
in
nature
right
there
that's
the
spot
another
little
tree
right
here
see
once
again
though
put
these
hands
in
layers
layer
after
layer
I
know
what
let's
do
maybe
maybe
there's
a
stone
here
if
you
need
a
little
place
to
sit
so
let's
let's
just
put
us
in
just
a
little
stone
we
can
set
right
here
and
be
comfortable
little
white
a
little
brown
we
go
right
in
here
and
drop
the
indication
of
a
little
highlight
on
top
of
that
stone
there
and
if
you
take
care
of
this
stone
treated
right
it'll
grow
up
to
be
a
big
mountain
like
back
there
that
we
know
that's
not
true
but
it
sounds
good
it
sounds
good
probably
just
the
opposite
that
used
to
be
a
big
mountain
has
just
got
wore
down
to
that
there
now
we
can
bring
some
of
our
little
bushes
right
around
if
you
have
trouble
making
these
stick
add
a
little
tiny
amount
of
liquid
white
to
your
brush
there's
one
so
even
here
where
they're
crowded
do
one
of
the
time
so
you
have
individuals
in
there
give
each
one
of
a
name
if
necessary
I'm
just
gonna
take
the
knife
scratch
through
the
paint
to
create
the
illusion
of
sticks
twigs
all
kinds
of
little
things
that
are
happening
that
helps
you
all
different
planes
normally
I
do
it
in
the
dark
areas
not
in
the
light
house
the
light
areas
indicate
leaves
and
stuff
that
are
on
this
side
the
dark
areas
show
you
know
where
you're
looking
down
between
the
sticks
are
between
the
bushes
and
you
can
see
down
into
it
the
shadow
areas
need
to
see
those
little
sticks
some
mainly
in
the
dark
areas
a
little
Van
Dyck
Brown
put
some
land
right
out
here
did
you
use
all
kinds
of
hippie
things
out
here
watch
watch
that
goes
dropped
in
there
a
little
bit
of
our
highlight
color
that
was
just
dark
seeing
a
little
white
looks
like
I
hit
a
little
blue
there
too
and
that's
just
right
that
graze
it
down
a
little
bit
makes
it
even
better
little
touch
little
touch
of
liquid
white
I'm
just
going
to
pull
that
out
flap
and
pull
it
out
like
so
drop
my
knife
cross
it
once
again
using
a
very
firm
pressure
very
firm
been
denied
that
nice
strong
you're
not
gonna
hurt
you
that's
another
question
I
hear
quite
often
is
that
my
knife
looks
like
it's
a
different
color
than
the
ones
that
people
buy
there's
not
there's
not
any
difference
at
all
the
only
thing
is
they
make
me
spray
this
one
black
so
it
doesn't
shine
but
it's
the
same
knife
that
you
have
same
identical
life
feeling
ripples
on
the
water
here
and
they're
their
sticks
and
twigs
liner
brush
whip
dip
it
in
the
least
a
little
bit
of
paint
thinner
make
some
paint
that's
very
thin
and
maybe
at
right
here
here
lives
old
ol
stick
he
lives
right
out
here
like
so
go
back
into
the
paint
thinner
and
do
some
bright
red
I
think
will
sign
this
one
this
is
a
painting
that
will
teach
you
how
to
use
all
the
equipment
and
it's
always
one
of
the
more
popular
things
that
we
do
these
mountains
and
evergreens
everybody
likes
these
so
on
behalf
of
the
entire
staff
happy
painting
and
god
bless
production
of
this
program
is
made
possible
by
a
grant
from
the
Martin
F
Weber
company
manufacturers
of
fine
artists
