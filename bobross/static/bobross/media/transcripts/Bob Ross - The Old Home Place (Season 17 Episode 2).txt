welcome
back
certainly
glad
you
could
join
me
today
and
today
I'd
like
to
introduce
you
to
some
little
friends
that
I
have
with
me
this
is
four
little
chimney
sweeps
and
they're
just
sort
of
hanging
right
here
on
my
shirt
these
are
the
cutest
little
devils
and
they
live
in
tending
oh
we
got
one
that's
hungry
here
and
a
lot
of
people
here
I'm
in
the
chimney
but
not
too
often
do
you
get
a
chance
to
see
them
and
believe
it
or
not
in
this
mess
of
birds
here
there
are
four
of
them
there's
one
hidden
under
there
and
their
little
babies
just
a
couple
of
weeks
old
I
thought
you
might
enjoy
seeing
these
I
borrowed
these
from
Diana
Schaefer
the
bird
lady
here
in
Muncie
to
show
you
so
I
tell
you
what
let's
haven't
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
today
and
while
they're
doing
that
I'll
see
if
I
can
get
these
Rascals
off
my
shirt
and
we'll
get
started
here
this
is
like
pulling
leeches
off
so
we
just
take
them
right
off
they
have
unbelievable
little
claws
come
out
so
here
we
go
here's
one
yeah
let's
say
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
them
falling
all
right
there
okay
today
I
have
my
standard
old
18
by
24
inch
canvas
up
here
this
is
a
triple
primed
canvas
so
it's
all
ready
to
go
and
I've
covered
it
with
a
nice
thin
even
coat
of
the
liquid
white
so
it's
wet
and
slick
and
we
can
get
started
they
think
it's
time
to
eat
let's
have
some
fun
today
let's
start
out
the
day
with
a
little
touch
of
the
CAD
yellow
just
a
small
amount
on
the
brush
just
just
sort
of
tap
the
bristles
into
it
so
you
get
a
little
tiny
bit
we
don't
want
to
overload
it
just
a
little
bit
okay
let's
go
right
up
here
and
this
is
such
a
fantastic
day
let's
do
just
a
beautiful
happy
little
painting
put
a
little
tiny
bit
of
this
yellow
into
the
sky
just
a
small
amount
just
somewhere
right
along
in
there
now
then
without
cleaning
the
brush
I
want
to
add
a
little
touch
of
the
yellow
ochre
and
we'll
put
a
little
touch
of
that
in
there
just
let
them
blend
together
just
happy
little
colors
they
make
you
feel
good
they're
nice
and
bright
warm
colors
now
then
maybe
let's
still
without
cleaning
the
brush
because
I'm
lazy
I
look
for
easy
ways
to
do
things
a
little
of
the
lizard
crimson
just
a
small
amount
right
down
in
here
we'll
just
add
a
little
touch
of
crimson
and
we're
just
making
little
crisscross
strokes
a
little
axis
solvers
to
it
and
just
allow
these
colors
to
blend
together
just
blend
right
together
maybe
even
a
little
bit
of
that
crimson
up
in
here
wherever
you
want
to
just
sort
of
look
around
and
decide
where
you
think
it
should
live
in
your
painting
hope
you
enjoy
the
little
birds
and
stuff
that
we
show
on
the
program
I'm
such
a
fanatic
for
god's
little
creatures
that
i
like
to
share
those
with
you
there
we
are
yeah
then
maybe
we
have
a
little
light
spot
right
here
so
I
tell
you
what
maybe
I'll
just
take
my
finger
and
take
a
little
touch
of
that
crimson
just
a
very
small
amount
of
paint
it
will
just
put
the
indication
of
a
little
Sun
up
in
there
we
can
take
the
big
brush
and
blend
it
and
this
will
soften
it
to
any
degree
of
lightness
or
darkness
that
you
want
you
can
just
soften
it
until
it
goes
away
if
you
want
to
we
want
to
keep
a
little
tiny
bit
of
it
there
just
enough
that
is
a
little
indication
and
then
put
some
little
clouds
up
there
and
for
that
I'm
gonna
take
some
alizarin
crimson
and
a
touch
just
a
touch
of
the
phthalo
blue
now
the
phthalo
blue
is
many
many
times
stronger
than
a
crimson
so
proportionately
we're
using
much
much
more
crimson
and
then
we
are
blue
be
very
careful
at
blue
is
so
strong
and
lean
up
your
whole
world
in
a
heartbeat
now
we
just
take
the
old
large
brush
I
still
haven't
cleaned
it
still
and
cleaned
it
just
tap
a
little
color
into
it
and
maybe
up
in
here
live
some
nice
just
happy
little
stringy
clouds
across
here
now
if
you
was
to
use
blue
by
itself
to
do
this
and
you
touch
the
yellow
oh
my
gosh
well
you
know
what
it
happens
you'd
have
bright
green
and
in
this
particular
painting
I'm
not
looking
for
a
green
sky
so
by
using
this
lavender
color
if
when
we
hit
the
yellow
the
worst
that
can
happen
is
it
turns
a
beautiful
brownish
color
and
that's
okay
we
can
live
with
that
today
maybe
just
one
right
in
here
you
have
to
make
big
decisions
of
Hoarders
your
little
clouds
live
they
just
float
around
have
fun
all
day
there
is
another
one
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
let's
go
to
the
side
over
here
we
have
a
few
coming
in
here
little
stringy
clouds
there
I
just
sort
of
stair-step
this
one
maybe
it
comes
right
on
down
might
go
right
up
to
the
Sun
there
just
right
up
to
it
and
and
a
little
bit
right
along
here
this
will
this
will
be
our
horizon
let
alone
this
area
so
we
just
put
a
little
color
right
here
wherever
you
wanted
okay
now
long
last
will
wash
the
brush
and
we
wash
our
brush
with
odorless
thinner
shake
off
the
excess
and
then
just
leave
the
devil
at
it
that's
the
most
fun
part
of
this
whole
technique
take
out
all
your
frustrations
and
hostilities
be
sure
your
brush
is
good
and
dry
barely
touching
barely
touching
three
hairs
and
some
air
just
gently
blend
the
sky
and
Yubel
end
it
to
any
degree
of
softness
that
you
want
you
can
continue
to
blend
it
till
it's
just
as
soft
as
velvet
or
you
can
leave
it
quite
strong
it's
up
to
you
it's
up
to
you
painting
is
a
very
individual
thing
so
you
have
to
make
big
decisions
in
your
world
there
now
then
tell
you
let's
take
that
same
color
we'll
just
add
a
little
bit
more
to
the
two-inch
brush
it's
the
hanging
old
brush
just
a
little
bit
of
color
maybe
back
in
here
mm
somewhere
in
here
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
Hill
that
lives
back
here
I
want
it
almost
the
same
color
as
the
sky
very
soft
very
subdued
it's
far
away
far
far
away
don't
let
it
get
too
strong
on
your
to
stand
out
we
want
this
to
be
we
off
the
distance
somewhere
far
away
far
far
away
there
so
you
need
now
there
we
are
or
see
our
camera
crew
there
now
we
can
soften
that
so
it
just
sets
we
back
here
now
then
let's
have
some
maybe
some
little
grassy
areas
in
there
shoot
we
don't
take
we
just
use
that
same
color
I'm
going
to
add
a
little
Van
Dyke
Brown
to
it
maybe
a
little
black
just
want
to
darken
up
a
little
bit
but
the
same
lavender
color
with
a
little
banding
little
black
mixed
just
so
it's
darker
and
let's
begin
tapping
in
some
basic
little
shapes
here
maybe
there's
a
little
he'll
lives
right
there
maybe
it
comes
down
just
make
a
decision
you
have
unlimited
power
here
you
can
create
any
illusion
that
you
can
conceive
in
your
mind
so
just
allow
that
to
happen
allow
it
to
happen
there
again
thinking
about
where
you
want
all
these
little
things
to
live
see
now
you
can
see
how
distant
that
Hill
looks
it
really
doesn't
show
up
well
do
you
put
something
in
front
of
it
there
and
we're
always
playing
darks
against
light
lights
against
dark
continually
continue
the
finest
paint
made
can
only
capture
a
small
portion
of
light
so
we
have
to
work
with
illusions
and
when
you
paint
you
play
once
again
lights
against
dark
darks
against
light
there
we
go
there
okay
so
quickly
we
have
some
background
filled
in
here
and
you
could
really
just
wipe
this
on
this
is
just
a
super
way
to
practice
you
could
put
this
on
with
a
paint
roller
all
we're
doing
is
just
blocking
in
some
basic
color
here
there
okay
same
old
brush
I'm
not
even
going
to
clean
it
I'm
gonna
go
right
down
here
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
the
yellow
little
yellow
ochre
little
Indian
yellow
here
and
there
we'll
get
the
least
little
touch
of
the
bright
red
not
much
not
much
maybe
I'll
be
right
back
get
a
little
touch
of
the
darks
in
here
just
to
dull
it
a
little
so
it's
not
too
bright
little
touch
a
SAP
green
-
that's
getting
nice
but
by
loading
it
on
the
brush
and
mixing
color
on
the
brush
in
this
brush
now
we
have
a
multitude
of
colors
happening
it's
not
one
flat
oded
color
and
you
push
that
brush
give
it
a
little
push
that
loads
paint
right
on
the
end
of
the
bristles
and
with
that
then
we
can
go
up
here
and
very
lightly
begin
tapping
in
some
beautiful
little
grassy
hills
started
in
the
area
this
father's
too
way
from
you
and
work
forward
forward
forward
always
coming
forward
there
now
maybe
watch
here
see
maybe
it
comes
right
down
see
now
you
created
a
different
plane
there
that's
simple
that's
simple
what
power
you
have
there
we
go
and
I'm
just
going
to
bury
these
same
colors
back
and
forth
little
darker
there's
a
little
more
the
SAP
green
but
just
bury
them
back
and
forth
forth
and
back
but
now
the
lay
of
the
land
begins
to
become
very
important
so
begin
thinking
about
how
the
land
flows
the
little
hills
and
the
valleys
and
all
these
beautiful
little
things
in
here
all
you're
doing
is
tapping
and
the
more
you
tap
the
softer
it
becomes
mmm
you
can
hear
little
birds
in
the
background
there
yeah
they
just
chirp
it
and
having
a
good
tap
yeah
there
is
something
else
it's
nothing
else
in
the
last
series
we
we
showed
a
baby
owl
and
later
on
in
this
series
I'm
going
to
show
you
what
he
he
grew
up
to
be
because
he's
he's
a
big
owl
now
there
but
see
just
layer
after
layer
after
layer
in
as
many
and
a
few
you
want
now
sometimes
sometimes
sometimes
you
get
excited
and
you
see
nice
things
here
maybe
you
want
to
show
taking
a
little
bit
of
that
just
straight
titanium
white
maybe
there
you
want
to
show
a
little
light
zinging
through
here
so
just
add
a
little
white
to
your
brush
and
where
you
think
light
would
hit
just
tap
a
little
in
there
but
don't
overdo
if
you
overdo
then
it
loses
its
effectiveness
it's
effective
only
because
there's
a
small
amount
of
it
it's
like
gold
if
everybody
had
a
lot
of
gold
it
wouldn't
be
worth
anything
so
treasure
these
little
things
don't
don't
use
them
don't
use
them
all
up
there
good
friends
okay
to
you
and
shoot
at
such
a
nice
place
there
that
would
be
a
beautiful
place
to
have
just
a
happy
little
pond
let's
take
another
to
inspiration
I
have
several
deep
brush
going
so
I
don't
have
to
continually
wash
brush
then
we
had
a
little
touch
of
the
phthalo
blue
and
maybe
have
to
make
a
decision
maybe
we
have
a
little
tiny
body
of
water
here
we
back
here
pull
it
straight
down
just
straight
down
and
don't
worry
about
this
if
it's
something
here
that
you
don't
want
or
not
like
all
you
have
to
do
is
cover
it
up
let's
see
how
beautiful
that
is
with
that
lavender
that's
underneath
it
mixes
with
it
don't
fight
these
things
allow
them
to
happen
it
can
be
some
of
the
most
beautiful
effects
now
very
lightly
go
across
just
enough
to
give
it
a
sheen
or
watery
appearance
that's
all
it
takes
now
maybe
back
in
here
let's
make
take
a
little
white
little
white
a
little
dark
Sienna
like
so
just
white
and
dark
seeing
pull
it
out
as
flat
as
you
can
get
it
but
leave
it
marbled
so
there's
a
lot
of
color
is
happening
pull
across
get
our
tiny
little
roll
of
paint
right
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
and
maybe
there's
a
little
bit
of
land
back
here
just
a
little
and
all
I'm
doing
is
scrubbing
just
something
really
scrub
it
in
there
okay
all
right
now
maybe
maybe
our
land
continues
get
a
little
more
in
the
brown
little
black
a
little
alizarin
crimson
and
little
touch
of
blue
all
the
same
colors
again
maybe
this
is
a
very
small
little
pond
here
so
maybe
maybe
maybe
let's
have
it
come
right
along
here
so
not
much
of
it
shows
we
just
want
an
indication
there's
a
place
back
here
for
all
the
creatures
can
go
to
get
a
little
drink
there
okay
but
this
again
puts
another
plane
in
the
painting
and
each
one
of
these
planes
helps
create
it
illusion
of
depth
and
distance
and
to
me
that's
very
very
desirable
and
a
painting
there
we
go
tell
you
what
I
just
tell
you
what
let's
take
a
little
dark
sienna
and
white
we
just
use
that
same
old
brush
leave
whatever's
on
there
with
it
maybe
we
just
put
some
of
this
color
on
like
it
look
at
all
the
beautiful
colors
that
happen
because
you
don't
clean
the
brush
if
you
cleaned
it
and
started
with
fresh
color
you'd
have
one
dead
old
color
as
it
is
you're
picking
up
everything
it's
there
and
it's
all
mixing
together
and
just
beautiful
things
are
happening
okay
then
go
back
to
this
brush
it
has
the
yellows
on
the
greens
on
it
tap
and
a
little
bit
of
color
this
tap
give
it
that
little
push
see
how
that
loads
the
end
of
those
bristles
most
important
there
we
go
it's
surprising
little
ponds
like
this
sometimes
just
the
fishing
here
can
be
fantastic
when
I
was
a
kid
I
used
to
fish
in
little
ponds
like
this
all
over
Florida
caught
some
pretty
nice
fish
I
remember
when
I
was
only
about
9
or
10
years
old
I
was
looking
for
some
fish
bait
one
day
and
one
of
the
big
guys
in
the
neighborhood
tell
me
they
don't
the
larvae
out
of
a
wasps
nest
makes
beautiful
fish
beak
which
it
does
it
does
I
said
well
I
don't
know
how
to
catch
you
how
to
kick
them
so
this
guy
told
me
he
says
now
if
you
want
to
catch
if
you
want
to
get
a
wasp
nest
to
get
the
little
larvae
out
for
fish
bait
what
you
do
is
find
a
big
one
and
then
you
take
a
poll
and
you
sock
it
and
when
it
falls
down
you
run
and
grab
it
but
in
the
meantime
all
these
wasps
are
going
to
come
so
if
you
stand
real
still
like
a
tree
they'll
think
you're
a
tree
and
they
won't
bother
you
but
at
9
years
old
made
sense
to
me
so
I
went
out
and
got
a
big
Pole
on
my
biggest
wasps
nest
in
town
down
and
stood
real
still
and
these
wasps
use
my
face
for
an
aircraft
carrier
they
came
in
like
jets
team
and
my
eyes
literally
swelled
shut
I
spent
days
on
in
the
bed
didn't
do
any
fishing
for
a
long
time
so
if
anybody
tells
you
that
don't
believe
it
you're
going
to
knock
a
loss
nest
down
you
run
there
we
go
I
look
like
a
little
road
there
so
let's
just
put
something
on
this
side
that
easy
and
we're
using
the
same
old
colors
crimson
and
brown
little
touches
of
blue
all
we're
doing
is
just
applying
a
dark
color
so
we
put
a
lighter
color
on
there
it'll
show
have
to
have
dark
in
order
to
show
light
while
we
got
that
going
tell
you
what
I
see
something
else
here
I
see
something
else
same
old
colors
maybe
right
in
here
post
air
using
this
old
brush
maybe
their
lives
in
here
to
help
what
it
does
now
maybe
their
lives
in
here
a
big
tree
just
nice
tree
friend
new
tree
there
we
go
I'm
just
using
the
corner
to
brush
and
just
tapping
in
here
a
very
basic
little
shape
I'm
not
looking
for
any
detail
at
this
point
in
a
minute
and
a
minute
we'll
find
some
details
in
it
but
right
now
we're
just
looking
looking
for
a
nice
tree
shape
someplace
for
that
little
noisy
bird
to
stay
there
okay
and
maybe
comes
right
on
down
here
we
don't
know
we
don't
know
maybe
there's
a
nice
little
Bush
lives
here
whatever
you
want
just
have
to
make
a
decision
and
drop
it
in
okay
and
I
will
take
some
of
the
liquid
white
put
it
out
here
take
a
little
yellow
ochre
little
dark
sienna
not
much
just
a
little
maybe
a
little
more
the
darks
in
mix
it
all
up
there
now
this
is
very
thin
paint
let
me
clean
my
knife
then
to
clean
the
now
we'll
take
our
liner
brush
we're
going
to
some
paint
thinner
I
will
go
into
Van
Dyck
Brown
then
we
get
a
little
more
thinner
we
want
this
to
be
very
thin
paint
so
we
load
the
bristles
full
of
Van
Dyck
Brown
okay
now
I'm
going
to
just
go
right
down
here
now
take
where
we
have
this
liquid
white
with
color
in
it
pull
one
side
of
it
only
through
so
you
have
a
light
side
and
a
dark
side
see
now
let's
go
up
in
here
and
this
build
is
a
trunk
in
there
that's
all
we
put
a
little
more
color
to
the
dark
little
the
light
yet
to
be
careful
that
your
lights
always
on
the
same
side
and
get
nervous
let
it
wiggle
and
jiggle
and
have
fun
shoot
put
some
character
in
a
tree
don't
just
make
an
old
street
tree
these
are
so
much
more
interesting
when
they
have
some
shape
and
gnarly
I
like
it
word
gnarly
there
matter
tell
you
what
Shuba
we've
used
this
old
2
inch
brush
so
much
let's
just
add
a
little
bit
of
green
SAP
green
little
kid
yet
a
little
yellow
orange
and
yellow
whatever
you
got
there
tap
a
little
color
into
it
now
the
yellow
paint
is
thinner
than
other
colors
we
intentionally
make
that
to
a
thinner
consistency
so
it'll
stick
because
yellows
nearly
always
the
highlight
color
now
using
just
the
corner
that
big
old
2
inch
brush
you
can
begin
placing
in
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
leaf
indications
think
about
form
and
shape
it's
most
important
don't
just
throw
them
in
at
random
there
we
go
see
but
that
easy
using
a
big
old
brush
you
can
make
a
beautiful
tree
beautiful
trim
going
into
a
little
yellow
ocher
maybe
in
here
there's
another
little
bush
pick
out
a
few
little
individual
things
there
and
touch
the
bright
red
to
it
and
sparkle
it
up
a
little
there
we
go
maybe
he's
got
a
little
friend
that
lives
over
here
named
Clyde
or
whatever
little
bit
a
little
more
yellow
there
then
it'll
stand
out
there
you
see
just
changing
the
color
a
little
and
then
you
have
layer
after
layer
of
bushes
not
easy
to
shoot
maybe
there's
a
little
bush
loose
right
here
there
okay
good
take
the
point
of
the
knife
and
just
scrape
through
put
in
a
few
little
sticks
and
twigs
I
tell
you
I
tell
you
on
that's
such
a
beautiful
little
place
we're
to
have
a
little
house
there
let's
build
a
little
house
maybe
the
little
house
here's
the
roof
coming
right
here
I
scrape
it
out
first
that
sort
of
helps
you
lay
it
out
like
so
maybe
it's
a
porch
I've
got
a
porch
all
you
gotta
do
is
pull
out
down
out
the
house
can
live
right
there
and
we're
not
committed
yet
all
we're
doing
is
just
putting
in
a
basic
idea
there
but
it
lays
out
your
whole
cabin
and
at
the
same
time
it
allows
you
to
remove
some
of
the
excess
paint
I'm
going
to
take
a
little
white
a
little
touch
a
little
touch
a
sailor
blue
a
little
touch
of
black
just
a
little
like
so
okay
let's
build
us
a
roof
on
there
get
our
little
roll
of
paint
here's
a
little
trick
outline
it
first
with
a
knife
and
then
when
you
come
down
then
you
have
a
nice
straight
edge
like
so
just
let
it
go
it's
an
old
house
here
maybe
this
is
someplace
someplace
in
the
deep
south
I
was
born
and
raised
in
Florida
so
I
like
these
southern
scenes
let's
just
put
old
ol
southern
tight
pasture
it's
old
-
I
mean
it's
seen
its
better
day
a
little
bit
over
here
on
this
side
Thanks
so
now
then
maybe
maybe
this
little
house
maybe
it
has
like
a
screen
porch
on
it
so
that
just
sort
of
looks
and
dark
yes
or
looks
dark
they
all
porch
there
we
are
now
I
take
off
let's
take
white
least
little
touch
of
least
a
little
touch
of
black
in
it
a
little
touch
of
dark
Sienna
just
to
dull
it
down
real
nice
okay
and
then
over
here
soon
you
need
just
a
touch
more
of
the
CN
in
there
so
it
shows
up
a
little
better
there
we
go
very
nice
there
okay
and
did
be
a
little
shadow
little
brown
under
here
just
to
create
a
little
shadow
maybe
a
little
bit
running
right
down
there
and
we'll
take
it
same
color
and
add
a
little
white
to
it
so
it'll
be
a
little
bit
brighter
and
underneath
our
porch
out
here
PE
there
there
we
go
just
let
that
slide
right
down
through
there
we
can
take
a
little
brown
and
just
put
the
indication
here
and
there
of
some
nice
boards
and
maybe
you
can
make
out
here
and
there
a
few
little
things
the
rail
that
runs
right
along
here
okay
now
that
a
little
bit
more
the
Siena
I
want
this
edge
where
they
come
together
here
to
be
a
little
darker
so
it
shows
there
and
just
pull
it
down
so
it
blends
right
in
okay
and
you
know
then
let's
go
back
to
a
big
brush
the
bushes
here
growing
up
this
guy
cuts
grass
like
I
do
which
aren't
too
good
I'm
not
a
very
good
line
keeper
so
we'll
just
have
a
few
bushes
growing
up
around
his
old
house
like
so
and
sometimes
you
can
just
get
crazy
here
maybe
tell
you
what
maybe
take
a
little
brown
maybe
there's
what
remains
of
an
old
fence
and
then
maybe
when
I
have
it
starting
right
there
just
goes
right
along
the
road
here
because
because
if
you
had
a
beautiful
pond
like
it
there
probably
be
a
trout
in
there
and
everybody'd
be
after
your
trout
little
brown
and
white
so
we'll
put
up
a
little
fence
to
keep
them
out
their
little
highlight
on
it
now
right
through
the
liquid
white
and
let's
just
take
use
the
heel
of
the
knife
and
cut
in
the
indication
of
a
little
bit
of
wire
how
many
strands
you
want
two
three
ten
it's
up
to
you
that
easy
you
can
just
drop
them
in
no
problem
at
all
a
little
bit
of
color
come
right
down
in
here
put
a
little
grass
at
the
footage
of
these
now
we
can
take
our
big
brush
blend
that
little
path
right
it
just
the
way
with
one
over
in
this
side
here
we
need
we
need
a
little
bit
of
grassy
things
same
greens
and
stuff
and
we'll
tap
in
just
a
few
little
things
there
we
are
this
sort
of
reminds
me
those
place
I
grew
up
in
Florida
because
it
was
very
quiet
had
a
few
Hills
there
are
a
few
places
in
Florida
that
have
a
few
little
Hills
when
we
were
kids
we
thought
those
were
mountains
here's
later
I
never
suspected
I'd
end
up
living
in
Alaska
let's
see
some
of
the
most
beautiful
mountains
in
the
world
okay
I'll
tell
you
what
I
think
we
bad
have
a
finished
painting
take
a
little
bit
of
thinner
a
little
touch
of
the
bright
red
and
we'll
sign
this
one
I
hope
you've
enjoyed
it
and
once
again
I
hope
you
enjoyed
the
little
critters
that
we
had
on
the
beginning
of
the
show
I
certainly
enjoy
bringing
them
to
you
so
from
all
of
us
here
I'd
like
to
wish
you
happy
painting
and
God
bless
you
you
