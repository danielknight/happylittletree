hey
welcome
back
glad
you
could
join
me
today
today
I
thought
we'd
do
a
fantastic
little
painting
maybe
that's
maybe
it's
deep
in
the
woods
it's
very
dark
and
Misty
and
I
think
you'll
enjoy
them
so
let's
start
out
and
have
them
graphically
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
do
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
and
they'll
come
across
in
the
same
orders
I
have
them
on
the
palette
starting
with
the
white
and
working
around
or
they're
doing
that
let's
go
on
up
here
I
have
the
good
old
standard
18
by
24
inch
canvas
and
I've
already
covered
it
with
a
thin
even
coat
of
the
liquid
white
and
it's
all
wet
and
slick
in
it
it's
ready
to
do
a
fantastic
oil
painting
on
so
let's
let's
just
take
off
and
have
some
fun
today
let's
start
tell
you
what
let's
use
a
little
phthalo
blue
halo
blue
will
pick
up
a
little
SAP
green
so
we
have
phthalo
blue
and
SAP
green
just
sort
of
mix
them
on
the
brush
a
little
bit
of
paint
I
don't
have
a
whole
bunch
of
paint
now
then
we're
gonna
be
deep
in
the
woods
we
need
some
just
nice
colors
back
in
here
so
just
sort
of
dance
this
around
twirl
it
let
it
play
don't
get
it
too
even
we
want
it
to
be
dark
in
areas
and
light
in
areas
and
use
a
lot
of
pressure
in
places
and
don't
pressure
a
lot
of
pressure
no
pressure
just
make
all
these
little
different
things
happen
just
like
so
it
looks
like
so
the
more
coloring
the
brush
will
just
cover
the
whole
top
of
the
canvas
like
is
really
push
hard
when
you
want
it
to
be
darker
and
then
where
you
want
it
light
just
let
it
caress
the
canvas
just
very
gentle
very
soft
then
every
once
a
while
you
can
get
tough
and
just
grind
it
in
see
it
makes
a
nice
dark
spot
it's
blue
stay
little
blue
and
SAP
green
just
mix
on
the
brush
they're
a
little
darker
right
in
there
and
you
don't
care
where
this
goes
just
let
it
just
let
it
blend
down
and
play
wherever
where
it
makes
no
difference
okay
man
let
me
wash
the
brush
and
we
wash
your
brush
with
over
Liston
I
have
a
screen
in
the
bottom
of
this
bucket
that
I
scrub
the
the
brush
against
shake
out
the
excess
just
beat
the
devil
out
of
it
that's
all
there
is
to
it
now
then
with
a
clean
dry
brush
no
the
right
back
up
in
here
and
just
bring
all
this
together
and
you
can
over
blend
it
till
it
becomes
just
one
solid
mass
of
color
I
don't
want
to
lose
all
these
light
and
dark
areas
here
I
just
want
to
bring
it
together
just
just
about
like
so
right
in
there
there
sometimes
it's
hard
to
stop
things
get
working
so
well
you
just
want
to
keep
going
there
when
we're
all
finished
I
hope
this
looks
like
trees
we
back
in
the
distance
all
kinds
of
little
things
will
be
happening
back
here
okay
gives
us
a
nice
little
background
we
just
go
across
take
out
the
brushstrokes
I'm
gonna
have
some
water
down
here
so
I'll
use
some
they
little
blue
some
sample
green
and
I'll
add
a
little
black
don't
make
this
dark
and
I'll
just
I'm
gonna
have
water
maybe
right
in
here
a
little
bit
more
to
the
blackish
cuz
there
we
go
want
this
to
be
dark
start
at
the
bottom
because
I
want
to
be
the
darkest
and
then
work
back
upward
that
way
is
gonna
pick
up
the
liquid
white
and
automatically
it
gets
lighter
and
value
that's
where
our
water
will
be
somewhere
in
there
we
don't
really
care
it
okay
wash
the
old
brush
it
one
more
time
that's
the
most
fun
part
of
this
whole
technique
just
just
washing
the
brush
sometimes
they
slip
out
your
hand
go
across
the
room
there
yeah
I'm
gonna
take
the
liner
brush
put
some
thinner
on
it
and
go
right
into
a
little
bit
of
Van
Dyck
Brown
now
this
paint
is
thin
like
water
it's
about
the
consistency
of
ink
turn
that
brush
pull
it
to
a
nice
sharp
point
see
they're
good
let's
go
up
here
and
then
we're
going
to
start
making
some
decisions
there's
all
kind
of
trees
that
live
in
here
just
wherever
you
think
they
should
live
that's
where
they're
11
look
at
them
these
are
for
wheat
trees
now
we
can
just
put
the
indication
here
in
their
happy
little
limb
if
it
doesn't
want
to
flow
off
your
brush
add
a
little
bit
more
the
thinner
see
and
then
it'll
just
flow
and
I'm
just
gonna
put
in
some
basic
indications
when
you're
at
home
you
have
all
kinds
of
time
you
can
put
in
just
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
there
we
go
just
wherever
you
think
there
should
be
a
tree
that's
exactly
where
it
should
be
and
you
can
lift
up
some
people
find
it
easier
to
lift
upwards
some
I'd
easier
to
pull
down
try
it
both
ways
whichever
works
the
best
for
you
then
that's
the
right
way
there
see
just
many
as
you
want
or
as
few
and
don't
make
them
all
straight
trees
grow
every
which
way
some
of
them
have
little
little
kink
settlement
they're
like
people
everybody's
different
trees
are
different
let
them
be
individuals
that
I'm
have
personalities
there
they
go
see
how
them
little
rascals
well
it
looks
like
a
looks
like
woods
already
back
here
sometimes
it's
nice
when
these
paintings
dry
to
have
a
tree
trunk
that
has
some
shine
to
it
so
for
that
I
use
liquid
clear
take
a
little
liquid
clear
and
thinned
the
paint
down
now
put
these
in
tree
trunks
at
a
little
bit
closer
now
when
this
dries
these
trunks
it'll
look
almost
like
they're
glazed
my
glaze
it
just
that's
a
thin
paint
with
an
oil
base
that's
put
over
the
old
master
used
to
use
a
lot
of
glazing
it's
very
pretty
that
will
help
push
all
those
in
back
here
farther
back
there
we
go
they're
just
wherever
you
want
these
there
we
go
don't
want
to
get
too
carried
away
here
you
can
spend
all
day
just
putting
in
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
tree
trunks
all
right
the
liner
brush
does
fantastic
things
the
liner
brush
is
nice
because
it
has
a
long
hair
on
it
here
and
it
holds
a
lot
of
paint
okay
now
then
today
I'm
going
to
use
the
oval
brush
and
I'm
going
to
mix
up
let's
take
some
of
the
phthalo
blue
levels
half
green
and
I'm
going
to
reach
right
over
here
grab
a
little
touch
of
white
go
to
the
bluish
side
there
we
go
so
that's
a
little
blue
SAP
green
patch
of
white
I'm
going
to
add
a
little
blacks
too
bright
too
bright
a
little
more
height
so
you
can
see
Oakley
gap
good
good
very
nice
that's
taken
the
old
oval
brush
and
just
load
a
little
bit
of
paint
we
don't
want
a
whole
bunch
it
let's
go
right
up
in
here
and
then
just
begin
just
putting
a
few
little
details
see
how
it
makes
a
brush
makes
it
look
like
your
Stalin's
of
little
leaves
on
those
Rascals
super
for
that
man
I'm
just
barely
barely
tapping
barely
tapping
just
sort
of
look
at
where
you
think
they
might
live
drop
them
in
drop
oh
man
if
you
wanted
to
have
more
curve
on
them
and
hold
a
brush
downward
if
you
want
to
be
straight
go
straight
in
see
and
then
eat
just
barely
touching
allow
the
canvas
to
take
off
what
it
wants
I
may
be
down
in
here
there's
some
we're
getting
into
some
things
are
a
little
bit
thicker
so
nice
bushy
creatures
I
live
here
just
like
some
and
some
it
just
sort
of
float
around
Raqqa
there
there's
one
he
lives
right
there
so
you
just
have
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
in
the
world
all
kinds
of
little
things
pushes
everything
back
all
right
maybe
over
in
here
there's
some
just
some
little
indications
these
will
just
sort
of
show
through
and
it'll
look
like
there's
all
kind
of
little
branches
and
leaves
squirrels
that
have
a
place
to
hide
I
call
squirrels
tree
urchins
because
they
live
in
a
tree
have
a
whole
bunch
of
render
I
live
and
they
come
down
and
they
I
feed
them
come
in
it
they
come
eat
all
time
at
the
house
have
all
kind
of
little
creatures
ever
had
Coons
and
possums
bunny
rabbits
there
we
go
on
the
last
show
that
I
showed
you
my
little
bird
maybe
I'll
show
him
again
we've
got
we
were
beginning
to
get
so
many
calls
about
him
maybe
we'll
just
have
to
show
him
again
already
tell
you
what
let's
do
let's
take
a
little
brown
this
is
just
straight
Van
Dyck
Brown
let's
start
making
some
decisions
maybe
there's
some
land
that
lives
back
here
just
all
I'm
doing
here
just
pushing
in
some
color
just
like
so
just
a
little
color
no
big
deal
right
now
a
little
big
deal
would
take
a
little
white
a
little
light
blue
dark
sienna
let's
pull
it
out
cut
us
off
a
little
bit
then
barely
touch
just
put
the
indication
of
a
little
highlight
here
and
there
I
don't
want
too
much
this
is
too
far
back
it's
too
dark
back
in
here
it's
too
dark
and
it
will
use
a
whole
number
6
fan
brush
I
will
go
right
into
some
yellow
I
went
into
the
liquid
white
first
going
into
some
yellow
reach
up
here
and
grab
some
SAP
green
over
here
a
little
bit
of
black
there
what
what
is
to
be
quite
dark
Oh
yellow
ocher
to
it
this
mix
these
on
the
brush
okay
now
maybe
back
in
here
we're
beginning
to
see
a
little
color
just
push
upward
with
that
brush
just
pushing
upward
look
at
their
sink
and
all
these
little
things
just
sort
of
happen
here
and
maybe
I'm
using
that
oval
brush
again
here
I'm
going
to
add
a
little
color
and
just
put
the
least
little
touch
of
highlight
here
and
there
not
much
not
much
yet
will
we
get
into
the
foreground
and
we
will
get
adding
more
highlights
but
right
now
right
now
I
just
want
the
least
little
indication
here
and
there
a
little
light
playing
through
there
begin
picking
out
just
sort
of
some
individual
little
bushes
yeah
tell
you
what
must've
let
me
find
reusable
fan
brush
liquid
white
titanium
white
load
the
brush
full
of
paint
a
lot
of
paint
okay
let's
go
right
up
here
maybe
there's
some
happy
little
water
coming
right
down
through
here
and
it's
just
bubbling
along
having
a
good
time
splashing
carrying
on
just
just
think
how
water
would
think
you
know
just
pretend
you
water
coming
down
here
and
having
a
good
time
and
just
the
world's
happy
and
it's
a
good
day
and
all
of
a
sudden
oh
do
you
fall
over
it
just
it
falls
right
over
look
at
that
not
easy
you
can
make
a
happy
little
waterfall
there
just
drops
right
over
but
you
need
the
dark
underneath
or
on
the
show
and
it
splashes
down
here
underneath
this
waterfall
it's
just
all
kinds
of
little
things
going
on
like
so
so
many
little
happy
thanks
put
a
little
splashy
here
and
there
maybe
true
this
is
stone
under
the
water
there
all
these
little
things
just
just
flash
a
little
water
actions
just
this
fan
brush
is
fantastic
for
doing
these
just
absolutely
unreal
and
sometimes
it's
fun
just
to
just
to
play
a
little
bit
behind
there
it
is
we'll
just
take
a
one-inch
brush
and
go
right
in
to
we'll
use
some
Brown
some
black
little
SAP
green
on
a
very
dark
green
here
let's
have
a
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
Bush
he
lives
right
here
just
push
upward
on
a
very
dark
little
bush
right
here
he's
in
the
shadows
in
my
world
in
your
world
maybe
he's
maybe
he's
in
the
sunshine
so
you
can
put
all
kinds
of
happy
little
little
highlights
on
him
but
in
my
world
today
and
I'll
have
him
in
a
dark
put
another
one
right
there
just
sort
of
close
all
that
the
enemy
see
it
pushes
that
whole
area
back
here
it
just
pushes
it
right
back
into
that
into
the
background
Newman
if
you
lived
here
you'd
have
to
have
a
way
to
get
over
this
little
stream
so
let's
do
that
let's
have
some
fun
I'll
take
some
Van
Dyck
Brown
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
bridge
here
and
I
take
like
maybe
it's
behind
these
bushes
now
you
can
see
is
a
part
that
goes
over
the
water
so
let's
have
it
come
up
and
then
maybe
like
this
we'll
put
some
character
it
and
then
it
has
a
little
bend
in
it
there
let
me
get
the
small
knife
small
knife
a
little
better
for
that
puts
a
little
post
on
here
see
there's
a
little
post
there
this
woman
liked
it
down
in
there
cute
there
we
go
that
one
goes
over
behind
the
bush
then
take
the
big
knife
look
I
had
to
put
a
little
rail
up
here
we
don't
want
anybody
to
fall
off
this
bridge
and
get
wet
hey
there
I
know
you
could
do
that
little
brown
and
hike
tiniest
a
little
bit
of
paint
now
I
want
to
go
along
here
and
just
show
the
indication
of
a
little
highlight
here
and
there
just
to
brighten
Eve
up
making
them
sing
in
the
sunshine
used
to
be
a
song
about
singing
in
the
sunshine
okay
back
to
my
small
knife
I'll
put
a
little
indication
here
on
these
post
little
knife
gets
right
in
there
and
does
these
little
things
there
maybe
here
and
there
the
light
really
hits
it
you
could
add
a
little
just
a
little
sparkle
quite
just
don't
overdo
just
hearing
there
may
be
light
singing
through
there
and
it's
right
there
to
kill
a
little
sparkle
like
said
make
some
little
rascal
jump
out
at
you
alright
there
we
go
and
then
we'll
push
this
little
bridge
behind
this
bush
we
don't
know
where
he
lives
whatever
their
same
thing
over
here
I'm
gonna
push
this
bridge
completely
back
behind
these
bushes
like
it
brush
is
too
slow
let's
get
a
big
one
go
right
into
my
Van
Dyck
Brown
I'm
gonna
have
a
lot
of
land
areas
and
big
rocks
and
maybe
maybe
there's
a
big
let's
just
do
it
just
just
take
the
big
brush
it's
a
straight
Van
Dyck
Brown
and
here
we're
just
applying
dark
color
maybe
there's
one
it
comes
right
on
out
here
all
you're
doing
is
laying
in
basic
shapes
we'll
go
back
with
a
knife
and
straighten
all
this
out
and
make
big
decisions
about
where
things
live
but
right
now
all
we're
interested
in
is
just
basic
shapes
maybe
this
one
comes
way
on
out
here
here
just
fill
it
up
just
fill
it
up
full
of
color
like
so
yeah
I
really
hope
you
enjoyed
seeing
my
little
bird
on
the
last
show
he's
coming
along
fine
if
you're
following
his
progress
SAS
say
we've
got
so
many
calls
maybe
maybe
on
one
of
the
future
shows
I'll
bring
you
back
let
you
see
him
again
I
think
I
think
you'll
like
him
he's
my
friend
and
I
taking
care
of
him
under
the
supervision
of
the
bird
lady
we
have
a
lady
here
in
Muncie
who
takes
care
of
all
the
injured
animals
and
stuff
and
they
call
her
the
bird
lady
she
keeps
me
straight
tells
me
how
to
take
care
of
all
these
little
creatures
in
fact
when
these
days
we'd
like
to
do
it
we'd
like
to
do
a
television
show
where
we
show
you
what
she
does
and
and
people
like
her
all
over
the
country
that
devote
their
time
and
money
energies
into
taking
care
of
all
of
god's
little
creatures
because
they're
super
special
people
so
maybe
one
day
we
can
do
that
all
right
yeah
same
old
dirty
brush
I
want
to
add
some
SAP
green
to
it
foolish
brush
in
one
direction
load
a
lot
of
paint
into
it
it's
just
tiny
little
bit
of
SAP
green
then
we'll
grab
some
dark
Sienna
-
so
we
get
dark
Sienna
Van
Dyke
Brown
and
SAP
green
maybe
maybe
over
here
there's
going
to
be
a
big
tree
it's
right
here
so
we
can
go
ahead
and
throw
in
some
dark
color
see
how
this
dark
it
sort
of
closes
in
make
sure
I
go
toward
the
water
if
it's
lighter
all
right
let's
do
the
other
side
maybe
there's
a
happy
thing
it
lives
wherever
you
just
make
a
decision
and
put
it
in
whatever
there
we
go
and
I
quickly
got
all
that
blocked
in
and
we're
ready
to
start
picking
out
some
some
beautiful
little
details
okay
you
know
it
might
be
find
we
find
a
one-inch
brush
we'll
dip
it
into
a
little
bit
of
liquid
white
some
yellow
no
more
Epsom
and
night-black
I
want
this
to
be
a
dark
dark
green
pull
it
brush
in
one
direction
one
direction
loaded
full
of
color
okay
let's
go
right
up
here
maybe
right
in
here
put
on
it
so
dark
leaves
just
begin
building
some
shape
and
form
into
this
big
tree
that
lives
here
just
like
so
look
at
all
those
things
see
but
think
of
individual
little
bushes
and
limbs
and
stuff
that
are
all
living
in
here
each
one
has
its
own
personality
all
kinds
of
happy
little
things
there's
one
you
can
just
make
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
building
layers
to
the
one
that's
farthest
away
first
and
work
forward
that
way
it
it
has
depth
and
distance
in
there
a
little
yellow
ochre
to
that
maybe
there's
one
right
here
this
side
a
little
bit
of
light
singing
through
there
saying
you
can
leave
some
of
them
dark
and
total
shadow
especially
when
you're
doing
these
deep
wood
scenes
or
you
can
use
almost
pure
green
so
it
just
barely
barely
shows
I
like
to
leave
some
of
these
that
are
very
dark
like
at
sea
and
here
and
there
the
lights
going
to
zing
through
and
sparkle
some
of
these
makeup
shine
look
at
that
right
darker
darker
darker
down
here
toward
the
base
leave
these
dark
areas
are
very
very
important
very
important
little
boy
shadow
brush
off
give
them
a
shake
there
we
go
now
then
let's
start
let's
start
picking
out
some
stones
rocks
use
some
dark
Sienna
here
a
little
bit
of
white
maybe
maybe
right
along
in
here
we're
beginning
to
see
so
nice
for
rocky
areas
still
want
this
to
stay
quiet
dark
quiet
dark
just
all
kinds
of
things
happening
tell
you
what
let's
do
that
up
here
now
watch
your
watch
you
this
is
so
much
fun
because
now
you
can
make
a
decision
that
there's
a
big
cliff
or
a
sheer
drop-off
right
here
bank
I
swear
I'm
looking
for
and
you
can
just
bring
that
around
and
leave
this
right
in
front
you
can
make
all
kinds
of
little
things
that
go
up
in
there
like
so
so
have
some
fun
now
sometimes
some
of
these
stones
get
just
full
of
little
grassy
and
mossy
things
so
just
tap
tap
the
fan
brush
like
so
okay
this
isn't
the
greens
and
the
yellows
and
all
you
do
is
just
tap
just
touch
pick
out
individual
stones
see
makes
it
look
like
it's
just
all
curves
a
little
grassy
slammy
things
the
things
that
are
wet
all
the
time
they
grow
all
kind
of
little
algae
and
it's
pretty
stones
look
like
they
have
fur
on
them
at
times
right
down
here
by
the
water
and
you
can
just
do
as
many
of
these
at
least
some
dark
don't
don't
kill
all
the
dark
look
at
all
those
little
rascals
just
like
so
okay
back
to
my
one-inch
brush
a
little
bit
of
the
yellow
and
green
now
then
let's
bring
all
this
together
and
we
could
begin
putting
all
kinds
of
little
bushes
that
live
here
see
they
follow
the
lay
of
the
land
coming
right
down
like
this
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
this
is
your
world
so
you
make
it
happen
you
make
it
happen
there
it
is
tell
you
what
tell
you
-
maybe
there's
one
lives
down
here
see
how
you
can
bring
all
that
together
and
we'll
go
back
with
our
little
fan
brush
and
this
puts
a
little
grassy
things
out
here
on
these
stones
-
we
don't
want
to
be
left
out
there
we
go
just
all
kinds
a
little
rascals
got
it
we
can
come
right
over
here
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
Bush
he
lives
right
there
just
sort
of
let
your
imagination
go
crazy
let's
get
the
small
knife
and
we
can
take
some
dark
brown
come
right
in
here
and
just
begin
adding
all
kinds
of
little
little
flicks
on
these
stones
spring
them
straight
down
you
get
a
little
let
in
the
water
don't
worry
about
it
don't
worry
about
it
can
fix
easy
see
just
all
kinds
of
little
little
things
and
then
glad
you
find
my
fan
brush
that
has
liquid
white
and
titanium
white
on
it
a
lot
of
paint
on
the
brush
lot
of
paint
now
then
let's
begin
cleaning
up
the
bottom
of
all
this
stuff
water
splashing
into
some
of
these
little
recessed
areas
here
look
at
that
that's
fun
splash
and
crash
and
maybe
it's
a
little
that
a
little
stone
underneath
the
water
just
sort
of
look
at
it
and
make
decisions
or
stones
underneath
the
water
all
over
yeah
sort
of
take
oh
there's
another
one
they
go
in
all
kinds
of
directions
this
water
is
just
churning
through
here
you
ever
listen
to
a
little
stream
it
has
one
of
the
most
peaceful
sounds
to
it
that's
always
been
one
of
my
fantasies
is
to
have
a
house
at
the
right
next
total
stream
and
at
night
you
go
to
sleep
listening
to
all
that
and
bubbling
and
churning
there
we
go
just
as
many
as
you
want
look
at
there
so
right
off
in
here
wherever
okay
now
then
that's
let's
take
it
I'm
going
to
dip
right
into
some
liquid
clear
brown
maybe
there's
some
nice
trees
soon
live
just
wherever
maybe
up
as
you
walk
or
as
view
you
can
just
drop
a
tree
here
in
there
just
like
so
a
couple
little
tree
lamps
here
and
there
there
we
go
and
I
would
take
our
oval
brush
put
a
little
we
put
a
little
brighter
yellow
on
it
the
old
clock
on
the
wall
tell
me
I
gotta
finish
this
up
just
tap
in
the
indication
of
all
kind
of
little
leaves
hang
in
here
see
there
is
that
easy
you
can
really
really
do
a
fantastic
little
painting
in
just
a
matter
of
minutes
as
I
say
the
old
clocks
tell
me
I
got
to
leave
you
for
this
this
time
but
I'll
be
back
so
we'll
put
a
little
leaf
maybe
there's
one
that
hangs
out
right
here
I
can't
I
think
that
pretty
well
gives
us
a
finish
little
painting
from
all
of
us
here
happy
painting
god
bless
