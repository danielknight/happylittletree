hi
I'm
glad
you
could
join
me
today
you
ready
to
do
a
fantastic
little
painting
what
come
off
let's
do
it
let's
start
out
and
have
them
graphically
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
do
this
painting
with
me
and
they'll
come
across
in
the
same
order
that
I
have
them
on
the
palette
starting
with
the
titanium
white
and
working
around
I
thought
today
would
do
a
beautiful
little
winter
scene
I'm
you
know
partial
to
winter
scene
since
I
lived
in
Alaska
for
so
many
years
so
let's
go
up
here
and
do
it
I've
already
covered
the
canvas
with
a
nice
thin
even
coat
of
the
liquid
white
it's
wet
select
ready
to
go
then
we'll
start
out
with
a
little
touch
of
the
bright
red
and
let
me
say
that
again
a
little
touch
it
is
very
strong
just
tap
a
little
bit
into
the
two-inch
brush
there
just
a
small
amount
I
guess
go
right
up
here
and
maybe
we'll
come
let's
go
right
in
here
just
put
in
a
happy
little
global
don't
want
to
set
this
on
fire
all
we
want
to
do
is
create
a
little
glow
right
across
here
be
careful
once
again
this
bright
red
can
eat
up
your
whole
world
in
just
a
heartbeat
there
now
that's
mixing
with
a
liquid
white
and
you
get
a
beautiful
warm
glow
and
maybe
maybe
we'll
just
put
a
little
bit
right
down
in
here
what
the
heck
anything
we
don't
like
we
just
cover
up
and
if
we
like
it
it's
already
there
without
cleaning
the
brush
same
old
dirty
brush
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
the
least
little
touch
of
Indian
yellow
it's
a
very
transparent
now
I'm
allowing
that
red
that
was
already
in
the
brush
to
mix
with
the
yellow
there
we
go
okay
just
go
back
up
here
now
right
above
the
red
small
amount
the
Indian
yellow
and
use
a
little
crisscross
strokes
little
X's
and
just
blend
all
that
together
it's
like
so
very
soft
and
very
quiet
and
we
can
just
take
the
clean
off
the
brush
down
here
we
don't
care
whatever
okay
now
then
I
have
some
midnight
black
going
right
here
we'll
take
a
little
black
and
a
little
bit
of
the
phthalo
blue
and
we
just
mix
it
together
right
on
the
brush
just
tap
it
I
still
have
not
cleaned
the
brush
I'm
lazy
if
I
can
keep
them
clean
the
brush
boy
I'm
all
for
that
can't
just
go
right
up
in
here
still
use
the
little
crisscross
strokes
and
drop
in
a
happy
little
sky
it
is
back
and
forth
gonna
come
right
down
into
there
like
so
get
a
little
touch
more
of
the
color
at
just
black
blue
the
black
in
there
just
a
just
a
gray
it
a
little
bit
alright
okay
we
clean
the
old
brush
now
as
you
know
that's
my
favorite
part
of
paintings
is
cleaning
this
whole
brush
shake
off
the
excess
just
give
it
a
nice
little
wrap
there
okay
now
just
a
clean
dry
brush
and
be
sure
it's
dry
be
sure
it's
dry
that
may
be
one
of
the
biggest
single
problem
areas
we
we
hear
people
talk
about
is
that
the
brush
is
not
dry
and
they
watch
their
painting
drift
right
off
on
the
floor
let
me
get
upset
with
me
and
I
really
I
really
want
this
to
work
for
you
and
I
want
you
to
be
happy
with
it
there
we
go
okay
very
soft
and
gentle
just
so
you
can
blend
this
to
any
degree
of
softness
that
you
want
just
sort
of
look
at
it
make
a
decision
and
go
for
it
this
is
your
painting
your
world
so
you
can
you
can
create
any
kind
of
illusion
that
you
want
on
this
piece
of
canvas
let's
have
some
fun
take
the
old
round
brush
I'm
gonna
go
into
a
little
bit
of
the
Van
Dyck
Brown
little
dark
sienna
and
just
tap
it
tap
it
very
firmly
and
let's
go
right
up
here
maybe
right
in
here
we
back
in
the
distance
lives
a
few
happy
little
trees
just
like
so
this
would
have
been
a
good
scatter
well
we
might
do
it
yet
we
might
put
a
happy
little
cloud
in
there
we'll
go
ahead
and
put
these
in
yes
like
so
there
we
go
these
will
be
far
far
away
okay
tell
you
what
let's
do
put
a
little
cloud
in
there
just
want
to
show
you
how
to
do
that
we'll
use
a
fan
brush
today
go
right
into
the
titanium
white
pull
it
through
a
little
lot
of
paint
into
the
bristles
a
lot
of
paint
okay
scoop
here
maybe
right
in
here
lives
a
happy
little
cloud
I
use
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
turn
it
wiggle
it
wiggle
it
now
normally
you
should
do
this
before
you
start
putting
your
background
trees
in
I
just
changed
my
mind
decided
I
want
to
put
a
little
cloud
in
here
but
when
you're
doing
this
at
home
I
would
I
would
really
advise
you
do
it
before
you
put
your
background
trees
it'll
save
you
a
lot
of
trouble
there
Maddon
let's
take
a
nice
clean
dry
brush
and
I've
using
just
the
top
corner
of
the
two-inch
brush
to
blame
the
bottom
of
the
clouds
out
barely
touching
tiny
little
circles
tiny
little
circles
see
there
now
lift
it
upward
this
is
a
big
circle
big
grab
it
lifted
upwards
you're
still
just
barely
touching
the
canvas
and
it
very
lightly
blend
the
entire
sky
see
there
in
that
here
you
can
drop
in
a
happy
little
cloud
clouds
used
to
drive
me
crazy
when
I
was
traditional
painter
I'd
work
for
days
trying
to
put
in
a
little
cloud
going
back
to
my
round
brush
the
dark
Sienna
of
the
pen
Dyke
Brown
see
just
really
tap
it
in
there
get
tough
with
it
tap
heart
just
go
back
up
there
I
tell
you
I'm
having
so
much
fun
these
little
trees
hey
there's
one
he
lives
right
there
right
there
we
don't
want
to
get
loneliness
giving
a
friend
his
friend
lives
there
I
mean
wherever
we're
going
down
here
we
really
don't
have
to
worry
about
down
here
yet
a
little
bit
later
we'll
begin
to
worry
about
such
things
but
right
now
all
we're
doing
is
applying
some
very
very
basic
little
shapes
I
just
want
that
pinkish
glow
to
be
really
shining
through
the
trees
look
at
that
maybe
there's
a
nice
tree
that
lives
there
think
about
the
shape
of
a
tree
Jenn's
think
about
it
make
up
little
stories
about
trees
there's
one
it's
a
little
taller
there
you
can
get
carried
away
with
these
I
like
to
do
trees
nobody
travel
all
over
the
country
doing
demonstrations
for
for
PBS
stations
and
other
fantastic
groups
all
over
the
country
and
it's
unreal
some
of
the
fantastic
new
modern
equipment
they've
come
up
with
recently
I
was
doing
a
demonstration
in
a
small
town
and
there
was
probably
about
150
200
people
had
showed
up
and
they
they
gave
me
up
and
tastic
new
microphone
and
it
was
wireless
I
didn't
have
any
wires
or
anything
on
and
I
forgot
it
was
on
so
just
before
the
show
I
went
to
the
bathroom
needless
to
say
with
a
wireless
mic
when
I
came
back
everybody
knew
her
I'd
dinner
I
don't
even
worse
what
I've
been
doing
afternoon
you
be
careful
sometime
all
right
there
we
go
we
get
a
basic
tree
lying
in
here
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
oh
we're
doing
just
tapping
now
then
let's
take
the
script
liner
brush
and
I'll
dip
it
in
a
small
amount
of
paint
thinner
and
I
want
this
paint
to
be
just
like
water
a
liquid
turn
that
brush
it
pulls
it
to
a
nice
sharp
point
so
sharp
it
is
and
it
has
long
bristles
on
it
kids
go
up
here
now
here
and
there
I
did
a
happy
little
tree
trunk
just
drop
them
in
wherever
you
want
maybe
there's
wine
that
lives
right
there
and
let
these
old
trunks
just
sort
of
wiggle
and
jiggle
and
carry
on
we
don't
want
them
all
to
be
future
telephone
poles
keep
it
moving
if
you
have
trouble
making
your
paint
stick
add
a
little
more
of
the
paint
thinner
okay
maybe
I've
been
this
whole
tree
there's
a
big
one
lives
here
turn
that
brush
as
you're
pulling
us
down
turn
it
allow
it
to
pick
up
all
the
color
that's
underneath
there
we
go
and
we're
gonna
cover
up
most
debbie
you're
not
really
looking
for
a
lot
of
detail
right
here
just
some
basic
shapes
moving
this
one
told
him
to
be
left
out
give
him
a
little
trunk
and
maybe
here's
one
sticking
out
through
there
I
can't
why
night
there
maybe
it
goes
I
don't
off
the
canvas
we
don't
know
where
it
goes
all
right
yeah
then
I
won't
take
it
another
round
brush
and
I
want
to
begin
highlighting
some
of
these
things
and
really
making
them
stand
out
so
start
off
with
a
touch
this
is
a
titanium
white
and
then
I'm
gonna
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
the
phthalo
blue
and
maybe
I
should
say
that
a
little
stronger
a
little
bit
it's
like
the
red
it
is
very
very
strong
very
powerful
you
lead
up
all
the
white
in
the
world
just
a
matter
of
a
second
but
say
tap
that
brush
you
really
want
to
get
a
lot
of
paint
in
there
a
lot
of
paint
okay
let's
go
to
the
canvas
now
I
want
this
painting
to
have
both
some
cool
colors
in
it
and
some
nice
warm
colors
so
let's
go
right
up
here
and
I'm
just
gonna
use
a
top
corner
of
the
brush
to
begin
tapping
on
all
kinds
of
little
things
like
it
maybe
I'll
add
a
little
more
white
to
my
color
so
you
can
see
it
a
little
better
there
you
go
there
see
just
all
kinds
of
little
little
frosty
Thanks
hmm
if
you
have
trouble
making
your
paint
stick
add
a
small
amount
of
the
liquid
white
see
just
sort
of
dip
it
right
down
into
a
little
liquid
white
and
then
go
back
through
it
and
because
this
is
a
little
thinner
then
it
will
stick
very
easily
takes
a
very
little
pressure
on
the
brush
there
we
go
right
here
maybe
lives
a
happy
little
Bush
see
see
fairies
this
is
what
keeps
a
little
rabbit
warm
in
the
winter
he's
got
to
have
a
place
to
cut
11b
be
cozy
don't
worry
about
hearing
this
cold
we're
gonna
have
snow
down
here
yeah
then
I'm
going
back
to
my
other
round
brush
and
with
it
I'm
going
to
a
little
bit
of
yellow
to
the
bright
red
a
yellow
ocher
CAD
yellow
and
into
the
red
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
now
right
here
where
this
nice
glow
is
I
want
to
use
some
nice
warm
colors
so
that
I'm
sort
of
bounced
through
just
let
him
bounce
through
add
a
little
more
Zeca
there
look
at
that
see
you
said
all
those
little
things
happen
and
work
in
the
layers
maybe
on
this
tree
here
see
the
lights
playing
through
there
lucky
there
all
those
little
colors
beautiful
little
things
happen
this
is
all
the
yellows
with
a
little
bright
red
now
sets
our
lights
coming
through
they're
over
here
to
will
Sparkle
these
up
with
a
little
color
still
working
in
layers
Indian
yellow
a
little
bit
of
the
red
let's
go
right
up
here
put
a
little
bit
out
in
here
they're
so
round
brush
makes
a
fantastic
little
leaf
effects
for
distant
trees
I
really
like
it
for
distant
trees
there
we
go
don't
get
too
much
don't
like
it
now
I'm
going
back
to
my
round
brush
that
has
the
blue
and
the
white
on
it
and
let's
begin
playing
some
of
those
colors
right
into
it
so
it
just
looks
like
a
light
striking
over
there
on
the
side
every
once
a
while
I'm
going
to
add
a
little
bit
more
of
the
liquid
whites
which
sticks
EEZ
okay
right
here
we
just
sort
of
let
these
come
together
look
at
that
all
the
little
warm
colors
and
the
cool
colors
are
all
playing
together
there
okay
let's
go
back
over
here
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
tree
where
we
could
just
quickly
drop
on
a
few
little
things
here
and
there
think
about
some
basic
patterns
just
don't
throw
things
on
at
random
there's
one
right
there
review
on
and
you
can
put
as
many
or
as
few
in
your
world
as
you
want
if
you
want
to
look
like
they're
hanging
down
use
more
of
the
brush
and
just
tapped
Evert
it's
also
a
super
weight
if
you're
painting
weeping
willows
they're
beautiful
trees
and
they're
probably
one
of
the
easiest
trees
are
to
paint
there
we
go
see
all
kinds
of
little
hangy
downs
okay
now
all
I
got
this
old
dirty
brush
going
here
I'm
just
gonna
pull
a
little
bit
of
this
color
just
like
so
I
began
thinking
about
the
lay
of
the
land
out
here
and
all
we
doing
here
is
just
putting
in
some
base
color
with
I'm
really
concerned
about
what
it
is
at
this
point
they're
some
happy
little
things
it's
picking
up
some
of
those
Browns
and
all
the
colors
that
we
have
in
the
trees
pulling
all
that
out
too
but
it
gives
you
a
feeling
of
the
lay
of
the
land
and
it
gives
you
a
starting
point
something
to
work
with
okay
let
me
find
my
fan
brush
here
we
get
him
and
let's
begin
putting
in
some
details
we'll
go
right
into
titanium
white
I
touch
just
a
touch
of
the
bright
red
okay
now
then
you
have
to
make
some
big
decisions
where
is
the
snow
let
it
begin
playing
pulling
it
across
see
use
very
little
pressure
and
that
color
it's
underneath
shows
through
and
it
automatically
will
make
beautiful
shadows
for
you
there's
always
little
bumps
and
stuff
just
create
all
kinds
of
happy
little
things
there
comes
one
I
see
one
right
there
see
then
blend
it
out
a
little
just
like
so
you
come
right
on
across
and
you
just
keep
going
on
them
however
many
you
want
there
is
another
one
just
lay
here
after
layer
after
layer
hmm
yeah
yeah
then
let's
have
some
fun
make
some
big
decisions
and
what
else
do
we
want
in
here
maybe
maybe
we
will
have
a
happy
little
cabin
you
know
me
I'm
I'm
crazy
about
little
cabins
hmm
so
let's
try
that
add
to
you
what
will
we
will
paint
the
cabin
let's
use
let's
use
a
big
brush
today
we'll
take
the
2
inch
brush
pull
it
through
the
paint
now
I'm
using
the
dark
sienna
and
the
Van
Dyck
Brown
and
just
mix
them
on
the
brush
see
when
you
pull
it
wiggle
it
wiggle
it
both
sides
and
then
sharpen
it
just
like
you
would
are
a
knife
just
pull
it
right
through
there
and
look
at
the
sharp
edge
look
at
that
comes
to
a
very
sharp
chisel
edge
okay
let's
go
right
up
here
now
you
got
to
make
a
big
decision
where
is
your
little
cabin
live
or
maybe
today
we'll
have
a
big
old
cabin
yeah
I'm
gonna
do
the
back
Eve
first
so
we
just
paid
it
off
like
so
hello
-
little
more
paint
and
then
we
pull
it
straight
down
all
we're
doing
here
is
applying
a
base
color
okay
we
need
a
other
side
of
the
house
see
there
just
pull
it
down
and
a
lot
of
paint
a
lot
of
paint
on
them
I
want
that
to
be
very
strong
then
another
side
right
here
straight
down
like
that
now
since
our
light
source
is
coming
from
here
we
want
this
side
of
the
cabinet
to
be
lighter
than
over
here
so
over
here
be
sure
this
side
is
good
and
dark
real
dark
so
it
stands
out
nice
okay
now
same
old
dirty
brush
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
a
little
bit
of
the
white
a
little
blue
and
just
tap
a
little
bit
on
the
brush
see
just
a
little
on
the
brush
here
do
both
sides
and
you
can
see
it
a
little
better
maybe
see
there
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
now
that
I
want
this
to
look
like
old
weathered
wood
so
I'm
gonna
do
is
just
start
touching
and
letting
it
bounce
and
come
right
down
can
you
see
that
looks
like
it's
old
old
old
looks
like
my
house
okay
now
I'm
gonna
do
the
same
thing
I'm
gonna
make
it
darker
once
again
I
had
a
little
black
to
it
once
again
we
want
the
side
over
here
to
be
darker
so
load
a
lot
of
paint
let's
go
back
up
there
now
then
over
here
we
want
the
same
basic
thing
see
just
barely
touching
and
let
it
work
down
so
it
looks
a
hold
you're
sort
of
touching
and
pushing
at
the
same
time
a
little
bit
on
this
side
I
can't
come
right
on
down
a
little
house
is
about
to
fall
over
now
then
we
can
take
the
knife
and
work
on
our
perspective
here
a
little
bit
see
yeah
you
can
just
cut
it
off
wherever
you
want
it
just
like
so
and
we
need
a
roof
on
that
cabin
so
we'll
take
some
of
the
titanium
white
we
use
at
night
let's
go
right
up
here
and
lay
in
a
little
snow
covered
roof
that
simple
just
let
it
work
right
down
and
you
could
take
clean
this
edge
up
make
it
nice
and
smooth
bet
it
overhang
a
little
bit
then
grab
it
and
pull
there
you
go
sorry
easy
it
is
to
make
a
happy
little
cabin
put
a
little
snow
on
this
side
I
can
have
at
least
least
little
touch
of
the
phthalo
blue
I
want
to
make
it
look
like
you're
that
edge
on
here
they'll
blue
over
here
stay
low
blue
with
white
tiniest
tiniest
not
enough
time
already
I
tell
you
what
let's
do
takes
Van
Dyke
Brown
pull
without
very
flat
cut
across
and
get
just
the
smallest
little
roll
of
paint
right
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
yeah
there
right
along
here
we'll
just
touch
and
make
the
indication
of
all
kind
of
little
boards
whole
weathered
boards
there
we
go
doo-doo-doo
-
-
-
and
you
can
put
as
many
boards
and
your
cabin
as
you
want
put
some
out
here
like
so
and
we
could
take
our
liner
brush
we're
just
a
little
the
liquid
white
on
it
we'll
put
indication
of
some
happy
little
icicles
hanging
off
here
there
we
go
there
we
go
fuel
R
on
this
side
and
every
mini
whatever
that
gives
us
a
little
icicle
this
old
guy
he's
probably
he's
probably
with
ran
out
of
storage
space
I'm
a
joke
saver
so
maybe
he
had
to
build
him
a
little
shed
it
lives
right
there
here's
a
side
like
so
put
a
roof
on
his
shared
only
Duany
share
to
get
full
of
snow
they're
just
a
happy
little
roof
it'll
touch
you
some
highlight
out
here
very
touching
we
need
we
need
some
boards
on
that
too
okay
that
way
once
again
can
cut
it
off

looks
like
two
big
guys

the
indication
that

somebody's
home

lights
are
on
there

a
little
touch
of
the
liquid
black
and

we
can
begin
coming
right

right
into
all
that
dark
color
just
look
at
there

a
nice
sharp

chiseled
edge

a
good
chisel
edge

is
very
sharp
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
tell
you
what
let's
do
maybe
their
lives
right
there
a
great
big
evergreen
tree
that
he
just
goes
right
off
the
top
of
the
canvas
just
use
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
tap
as
you
work
down
the
tree
add
more
pressure
tap
harder
and
harder
make
those
bristles
Bend
downward
make
them
this
Bend
and
that
easy
okay
happy
country
our
happy
big
tree
this
is
big
tree
he
comes
right
on
down
like
cat
and
we
can
take
another
brush
and
put
some
white
on
it
why
a
little
touch
of
the
blue
there
there
Cass
go
back
up
here
and
let's
just
put
the
indication
of
something
a
little
bit
of
snow
hang
in
here
and
there
don't
kill
all
the
dark
the
dark
is
what
makes
us
stand
out
there

go
just
here
there
okay

we
can
just
begin
playing
with
some
of
the
nice
things
around
here
I'm
gonna
just
take
a
little
blue
and
white
lift
upward
a
little
bit

begin
just
bringing
all
this
together
see

they're
always
sticking
up
out
of
the
snow
