all
right
welcome
back
certainly
glad
you
could
join
me
a
date
you
ready
to
do
a
fantastic
little
painting
with
me
good
tell
you
what
let's
start
out
and
have
them
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
and
while
they're
doing
that
let's
go
on
up
here
I
have
my
standard
old
pre-stretch
canvas
up
here
it's
been
covered
with
liquid
white
and
it's
ready
to
go
so
let's
get
started
I
thought
today
let's
do
a
little
winter
scene
maybe
one
that's
maybe
one
that's
really
cold
and
you'll
have
to
put
on
your
coat
for
this
one's
over
so
let's
start
out
with
a
little
touch
of
Prussian
blue
on
the
two-inch
brush
and
just
a
small
amount
no
more
reach
up
here
and
grab
a
little
of
midnight
black
to
a
very
little
color
both
of
these
colors
are
extremely
extremely
strong
so
be
careful
with
them
be
careful
they'll
eat
up
your
whole
world
in
just
a
heartbeat
okay
now
we
have
those
sort
of
just
mixed
on
the
brush
I
want
to
just
sort
of
dance
in
a
just
all
kinds
of
little
things
just
take
the
brush
in
and
do
little
circles
just
little
happy
circles
that
it
span
in
all
kinds
of
directions
just
back
and
forth
one
way
than
the
other
and
just
let
it
play
at
all
these
little
brush
strokes
happen
don't
stay
in
one
place
and
keep
mixing
look
like
a
back
a
big
gob
in
this
gap
just
keep
the
brush
moving
let
it
bounce
and
play
and
have
fun
just
let
it
go
maybe
love
darken
this
like
that
if
it's
darker
out
here
and
gets
lighter
toward
the
center
then
it'll
automatically
automatic
it'll
bring
your
eye
down
to
this
lighter
area
see
there
we
go
just
sort
of
that
disk
balance
and
play
and
have
fun
and
here
you
know
me
shoot
I
love
water
I'm
just
a
water
fanatic
so
let's
put
a
little
bit
of
water
in
this
painting
I'll
use
exactly
the
same
colors
the
blue
in
the
black
or
black
and
blue
whichever
whichever
and
let's
just
drop
in
a
little
bit
of
water
pull
them
outside
and
word
like
so
yes
like
so
there
they
will
go
over
to
the
other
side
add
a
little
more
paint
to
the
brush
and
do
the
same
thing
I
don't
know
exactly
where
we'll
have
water
but
wherever
now
I
want
to
leave
a
little
area
open
here
where
isn't
there's
no
no
color
nothing
there
but
the
liquid
right
and
I'll
show
you
why
in
just
a
second
there
we
go
but
pull
from
the
outside
and
if
you
start
here
and
pull
across
you're
gonna
get
great
big
marks
that
are
very
very
difficult
to
get
rid
of
okay
wash
the
old
brush
well
I
steel
brush
here's
a
screen
in
the
bottom
of
this
can
that
I
scrub
the
brush
against
and
screen
allows
this
that
allows
the
solid
materials
to
settle
to
the
bottom
it
keeps
you
thinner
relatively
clean
now
with
a
clean
dry
brush
I'm
just
gonna
grab
this
and
go
all
the
way
across
and
that
light
area
will
remain
there
and
it
look
like
a
sheen
of
light
coming
across
your
water
when
you're
done
sort
of
sneaky
huh
they
look
for
easy
ways
to
do
things
what
makes
the
style
of
painting
so
fantastic
even
if
you've
never
painted
it
this
will
work
for
you
there
we
go
I
can't
peer
in
the
sky
I'm
just
gonna
take
and
just
sort
of
wind
this
up
a
little
bit
just
mix
it
and
stirred
all
kind
of
directions
but
I'm
using
basically
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
I'm
just
sort
of
stirring
it
up
just
blending
and
mixing
just
letting
the
brush
so
to
slide
around
there
I
don't
want
to
kill
all
these
shapes
that
I've
made
but
I
want
to
diffuse
them
make
them
softer
there
okay
now
you
could
stop
right
there
and
have
one
very
nice
stormy
looking
sky
and
for
a
lot
of
paintings
that
would
be
just
right
and
make
you
a
beautiful
sky
but
let's
play
a
little
bit
today
tell
you
what
take
the
one-inch
brush
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
titanium
white
I'm
gonna
load
the
bristles
full
of
paint
a
lot
of
paint
a
lot
of
paint
let's
go
right
up
here
and
maybe
we're
gonna
have
a
bright
area
right
in
here
and
we'll
put
some
clouds
in
but
you
can
get
tough
here
and
just
take
the
brush
and
sock
it
just
sock
it
and
then
begin
just
blending
outward
just
let
all
these
little
things
just
sort
of
happen
and
play
see
sort
of
look
at
your
light
airy
isn't
it
and
these
shapes
will
just
sort
of
happen
automatically
they
just
sort
of
let
them
play
and
have
fun
in
there
wherever
you
think
they
should
be
that's
exactly
exactly
where
they
were
to
be
this
is
a
fantastic
way
of
making
some
beautiful
beautiful
sky
effects
just
like
so
that'll
blend
and
play
but
don't
stay
in
one
place
and
just
keep
working
if
you
do
it'll
end
up
looking
like
a
big
old
cotton
ball
in
the
sky
we
want
life
in
these
clouds
action
movement
yes
keep
them
going
keep
them
going
look
at
all
that
all
kinds
of
fantastic
little
things
happening
that
easy
there
we
go
okay
now
then
I
have
several
brushes
going
so
I
don't
have
to
wash
them
continually
now
then
with
a
large
brush
I
want
to
take
just
the
top
corner
of
the
brush
very
top
I
just
began
blending
the
base
of
each
one
of
these
little
individual
shapes
we
plate
just
blend
it
using
tight
little
circular
strokes
like
so
very
gentle
very
cheap
just
absolutely
just
barely
barely
caressing
the
canvas
make
love
to
the
canvas
gentle
very
soft
there
we
go
just
whisper
lightly
and
in
your
world
you
decide
how
many
clouds
you
want
and
drop
them
in
now
beating
the
brush
just
to
remove
excess
paint
that's
the
best
way
to
do
it
all
you
have
to
just
beat
the
devil
out
of
it
and
it'll
take
that
excess
paint
out
and
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
entire
brush
cleaning
procedure
now
then
we
want
to
fluff
these
clouds
this
is
two
hairs
and
some
air
I
mean
just
oh
you're
just
barely
touching
lift
up
upward
like
so
to
sign
give
them
a
little
circular
upward
stroke
there
see
just
like
so
just
lift
them
up
remove
the
excess
paint
and
very
lightly
very
lightly
just
blend
the
entire
sky
huh
isn't
it
something
that
easy
you
have
instant
clouds
there
all
right
tell
you
what
today
today
let's
build
some
almighty
mountains
I
like
big
old
mountains
lived
in
Alaska
for
over
a
dozen
years
and
Alaska
has
some
of
the
most
beautiful
mountain
ranges
in
the
world
so
we'll
take
some
pression
blues
a
midnight
black
little
Van
Dyke
print
and
we
just
mix
it
together
pull
the
paint
out
as
flat
as
you
can
get
it
get
tough
with
it
pull
it
out
cut
across
we
have
a
small
rule
of
paint
there
it
is
right
out
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
okay
now
maybe
their
lives
in
our
world
right
here
a
little
claw
little
little
mountain
lives
up
here
in
the
clouds
and
you
just
sort
of
decide
where
you
want
me
and
firmly
very
firmly
push
that
mountain
right
into
the
sky
get
tough
with
it
can't
tough
there
the
only
thing
you
worried
about
is
a
nice
top
edge
you
could
cure
less
what's
happening
anywhere
else
in
this
melt
now
we're
going
to
take
a
large
brush
and
we'll
grab
that
paint
it
would
pull
it
downward
if
you
can
see
the
entire
Mountain
it's
always
more
distinct
at
the
top
it
is
the
bottom
so
by
pulling
this
paint
down
like
it
automatically
it
mixes
with
a
liquid
white
and
it
gets
lighter
and
lighter
in
value
toward
the
base
of
the
mountain
see
there
and
it
let's
just
take
some
Street
Street
Oh
titanium
white
same
way
but
without
flat
and
cut
across
and
get
our
small
rule
of
pain
again
just
like
so
and
in
with
that
take
the
point
of
the
knife
put
it
right
up
here
at
the
top
and
no
pressure
no
pressure
at
all
just
touch
the
mountain
and
that
it
flow
right
on
there
it's
that
simple
no
pressure
though
probably
the
biggest
single
mistake
made
is
applying
too
much
pressure
maybe
there's
a
little
bit
on
that
peak
right
there
we'll
take
a
little
pressure
and
blue
and
white
just
mix
that
together
yeah
we'll
use
that
for
our
shadow
color
you
need
a
shadow
color
and
a
highlight
color
and
same
way
we
pulled
it
out
got
our
little
roll
of
paint
now
let's
go
right
up
in
here
and
in
the
opposite
direction
let's
just
put
some
happy
little
shit
goes
like
so
no
pressure
I
can't
say
that
enough
times
absolutely
no
pressure
and
you
can
continually
change
this
mountain
maybe
now
there's
a
see
that's
a
big
old
thing
this
right
out
here
dick
peek
at
your
mountain
so
you
can
do
anything
that
you
want
to
do
it
little
ridges
here
and
there
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it
clean
dry
brush
will
tap
them
very
lightly
following
the
angles
and
lift
upward
that
creates
more
mist
at
the
base
over
here
the
same
way
always
follow
those
angles
in
your
Mountain
tell
you
what
today
let's
have
some
flight
we'll
use
that
same
color
that
was
black
impression
blue
independent
breath
without
flat
and
get
our
little
roll
of
paint
again
always
a
little
roll
of
paint
it
may
be
over
here
today
on
this
side
we'll
put
a
monster
mount
this
will
really
give
you
some
practice
using
a
knife
and
if
you
can
make
mountains
with
this
knife
you
can
make
roads
and
houses
stones
or
anything
some
of
the
earlier
series
we
painted
entire
paintings
using
nothing
but
the
knife
and
mountains
we'll
teach
you
how
to
make
friends
with
it
and
that's
what
you
need
you
have
to
make
friends
with
the
equipment
there
once
again
oh
you
worried
about
set
a
nice
top
sheet
take
our
large
brush
grab
this
paint
and
pull
it
just
pull
it
it'll
move
cause
the
liquid
lights
on
there
it'll
move
and
it'll
mix
if
you
were
trying
to
do
this
on
a
dry
canvas
ooh
you'd
be
upset
with
me
and
I
don't
want
you
to
be
upset
I
want
this
to
work
for
you
because
it's
tremendous
amount
of
pleasure
in
creating
a
painting
that
you
see
in
your
mind
and
with
your
own
hands
if
you
put
on
canvas
it's
very
very
satisfying
psychologists
would
probably
tell
us
it
fills
some
inner
need
I
don't
know
about
that
it's
just
fun
and
enjoyable
ok
you
go
back
to
our
white
just
plain
old
titanium
white
and
let's
put
some
highlights
right
on
this
mountain
follow
those
angles
just
let
that
float
right
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
no
pressure
no
pressure
think
I
mention
another
series
when
I
was
teaching
my
son
Steve
to
pay
days
to
tell
him
just
just
to
pretend
that
he
wasn't
careful
his
hand
would
float
right
off
the
canvas
and
go
away
that
he
was
a
whisper
floating
through
the
Melvin
little
son
of
a
gun
can
paint
some
mountains
now
their
course
he
spends
all
his
time
trying
to
find
his
hand
and
float
it
away
there
will
come
right
in
here
and
drop
in
some
little
the
shadows
this
is
just
blue
and
white
there
we
go
but
you
see
just
from
this
exercise
what
fantastic
mountains
can
be
made
quite
simply
mixing
up
a
little
more
shadow
color
here
ran
out
fresh
blue
and
white
there
yeah
once
again
oh
you
can
go
right
back
in
here
and
maybe
into
your
world
you
want
to
have
a
little
peek
right
there
see
all
you
have
to
do
is
drop
it
in
make
a
decision
put
a
shadow
behind
it
and
that
easy
it
becomes
a
separate
and
complete
entity
our
clean
dry
brush
oh
shoot
got
here
to
myself
I
didn't
put
any
shadows
right
there
there
you
don't
put
a
shadow
behind
each
peak
doesn't
look
right
won't
come
out
and
play
with
you
it
go
off
and
he'll
go
off
and
leave
you
okay
let's
just
tap
right
here
still
following
those
angles
most
most
important
follow
those
ankles
there
see
and
lift
upward
very
gently
very
gently
always
following
those
ankles
over
here
go
in
this
direction
let's
see
in
just
a
couple
of
minutes
you've
made
two
planes
to
different
areas
of
fantastic
mountains
traditional
painter
I
might
have
spent
a
week
just
just
to
do
that
there
we
go
feed
off
the
excess
we're
ready
tell
you
what
we
just
take
it
same
old
mountain
color
that
we
had
that
was
Prussian
blue
been
like
black
Van
Dyck
Brown
I'm
just
gonna
mix
it
back
together
here
with
a
little
white
just
to
lighten
it
up
till
it
looks
about
like
so
on
me
let
me
wipe
my
knife
off
and
we'll
find
we'll
find
we
get
a
little
one-inch
brush
that's
good
now
I'm
just
going
to
tap
the
one-inch
brush
right
into
this
color
just
tap
it
that's
all
there
is
very
easy
and
then
let's
have
some
little
foothills
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
tap
on
some
color
see
all
you're
doing
is
tapping
once
again
the
only
thing
you
worried
about
that
nice
top
edge
just
relax
let
it
go
and
enjoy
that's
the
only
prerequisite
song
painting
should
make
you
happy
should
always
make
you
happy
if
it
doesn't
make
you
happy
you're
doing
the
wrong
thing
there
okay
see
and
I'm
started
working
in
layers
leaving
some
little
light
areas
in
there
and
those
will
show
up
just
working
new
layers
and
you
don't
care
if
you
get
some
down
here
shoot
we're
going
to
turn
that
into
reflections
so
don't
worry
about
it
it'll
be
one
of
those
happy
accidents
that
turn
out
so
beautiful
learn
to
work
with
anything
that
happens
anything
it
happens
because
God
made
trees
and
all
shapes
and
mountains
and
all
shapes
anything
that
you
do
is
right
don't
let
it
fluster
you
as
they
say
in
the
south
okay
now
while
I
have
that
color
on
the
brush
I'm
just
going
to
grab
this
and
pull
a
little
bit
of
it
down
this
will
be
our
reflections
like
so
just
pull
it
straight
down
even
though
this
is
Kurd
pull
the
reflection
straight
down
you
knew
that
there
we
go
the
street
yeah
yeah
we
are
reflections
okay
and
we'll
take
a
clean
1
inch
brush
and
very
gently
very
very
gently
you
want
to
grab
this
in
short
little
strokes
quarter
inch
high
type
and
begin
lifting
upward
and
layer
starting
at
the
top
and
working
down
just
lift
straight
up
straight
up
if
you
let
them
go
to
an
angle
it'll
look
like
little
distant
trees
and
if
they're
at
an
angle
it
looks
like
the
winds
blowing
about
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
and
all
your
trees
are
going
to
fall
over
so
even
though
it
comes
down
the
side
of
a
hill
or
whatever
trees
still
grow
basically
the
majority
of
them
will
grow
straight
up
they'll
go
up
you're
looking
for
the
Sun
in
the
light
and
all
those
good
things
this
is
one
of
the
most
fantastic
ways
there
is
of
creating
the
illusion
of
a
lot
of
little
trees
that
are
far
far
away
just
little
foothills
see
and
you
can
do
it
so
quickly
then
we'll
take
a
little
bit
of
liquid
weight
on
the
knife
they're
gonna
pull
it
out
flat
I'm
just
going
to
cut
like
yet
and
get
tiny
little
bit
on
right
on
the
bottom
of
the
knife
and
let's
go
in
here
and
maybe
there's
some
little
little
areas
of
snow
that
live
up
in
there
now
sometimes
the
liquid
white
is
real
thin
you
might
want
to
add
a
little
bit
of
titanium
white
to
it
just
make
it
go
up
in
there
a
little
better
you
sort
of
you
sort
of
have
to
test
yours
and
see
there
but
this
is
loaded
on
the
bottom
of
the
knife
normally
when
we're
making
water
lines
we
load
it
on
the
top
of
the
knife
this
is
on
the
bottom
okay
we
can
take
our
large
brush
pull
this
straight
down
straight
down
straight
down
like
so
then
go
across
mmm
I
gives
us
a
midst
of
reflections
come
here
now
we
can
straighten
all
this
up
clean
up
the
bottom
edge
is
bring
it
all
together
and
have
some
little
lines
that
patru
doubt
past
this
there
keep
these
lines
basically
straight
even
though
they're
coming
downhill
keep
them
straight
or
to
look
like
your
water's
going
run
right
out
of
your
painting
maybe
a
little
ripple
here
and
there
you
don't
want
this
water
to
run
out
on
them
run
out
on
the
floor
and
get
your
floor
wet
if
you
all
these
lines
basically
straight
like
stuff
and
we
can
take
our
little
one-inch
brush
and
just
grab
this
and
lift
a
little
bit
of
this
white
up
also
and
that
that'll
set
it
in
there
bring
everything
together
it
looks
like
little
snowy
areas
laying
in
between
the
trees
there
told
you
this
was
gonna
be
a
Coleman
and
it
over
here
on
the
other
side
tell
you
what
let's
do
clean
off
the
space
here
put
that
up
here
and
save
it
for
later
let's
take
up
big
gob
of
black
and
blue
put
some
Brown
in
there
mix
up
a
pile
of
paint
let
me
clean
off
my
knife
and
let's
use
the
old
fan
brush
today
take
the
fan
brush
and
go
right
into
that
pile
of
paint
load
both
sides
full
of
paint
a
lot
of
paint
a
tremendous
amount
of
color
on
the
brush
now
that
maybe
there's
some
big
evergreens
that
live
right
there
start
off
by
just
touching
to
give
you
a
centerline
as
sort
of
a
guide
and
use
the
corner
of
the
brush
as
you
work
down
the
tree
apply
more
and
more
pressure
I'm
still
using
the
same
corner
but
as
you
work
down
just
apply
more
pressure
that
little
son
of
a
gun
slip
right
there
and
you
right
there
and
you
brush
all
you
got
to
do
is
scare
them
out
just
start
at
the
top
and
working
down
there
and
you
put
as
many
or
as
few
trees
in
your
world
as
you
want
just
sort
of
look
at
it
and
make
a
decision
and
sometimes
you
can
put
the
layers
of
trees
by
that
I
mean
maybe
disre
trees
that
are
that
are
far
away
see
if
you
want
to
have
some
trees
that
were
farther
away
maybe
all
right
here
for
example
there
we
go
now
you
want
to
make
them
smaller
and
a
little
bit
lighter
in
color
to
show
distance
there's
one
skin
Valesky
my
friend
there
everybody
has
to
have
a
friend
you
need
a
friend
there
is
another
one
and
maybe
even
a
third
one
whatever
and
we
can
just
say
I'm
show
you
how
to
make
a
little
Peninsula
out
here
and
underneath
they
will
drop
in
a
little
color
take
our
big
brush
pull
that
down
go
across
and
that
easy
we
have
instant
our
collections
okay
I
will
take
Oh
let's
take
little
Prussian
blue
and
little
touch
it
white
like
in
a
dark
blue
color
here
just
on
one-inch
brush
and
let's
put
in
let's
put
in
some
basic
shakes
or
some
nice
little
bushes
that
live
here
we
will
make
some
little
snow-covered
bushes
today
singing
just
have
those
come
right
on
out
wherever
you
want
them
we're
everyone
you
need
to
start
coloring
here
in
order
to
show
light
it's
all
we're
doing
right
now
just
which
is
putting
in
some
shadows
then
we'll
come
back
and
add
in
all
the
nice
highlights
they're
back
to
my
fan
brush
it
has
white
white
and
a
little
pression
blue
on
it
white
impression
blue
let's
go
up
here
and
just
put
the
indication
here
and
there
of
a
little
bit
of
highlight
on
these
trees
don't
much
you
put
too
much
you're
gonna
lose
this
beautiful
contrast
just
on
these
very
dark
trees
and
while
we
have
that
we
can
go
in
here
put
a
few
highlights
in
these
little
grassy
areas
just
a
few
and
with
her
knife
little
water
light
here
that's
just
liquid
white
put
us
a
little
water
line
right
in
there
that'll
push
all
that
back
okay
now
we
take
a
one-inch
brush
and
I'm
going
to
dip
it
right
into
the
liquid
white
and
remember
our
golden
rule
a
thin
paint
will
stick
to
a
thick
piece
of
liquid
white
first
and
then
into
titanium
white
pulling
the
brush
in
one
direction
okay
add
it
let's
just
go
up
here
and
begin
creating
all
these
little
snow-covered
bushes
wherever
you
think
they
should
live
that's
where
they
ought
to
be
okay
do
one
Bush
at
a
time
swine
an
attack
dog
getting
too
big
a
hurry
just
drop
them
in
see
there
but
now
because
that
darks
back
here
these
will
stand
out
otherwise
otherwise
they
just
sort
of
fade
right
into
the
background
tell
you
what
right
here's
a
nice
place
for
a
little
cabin
we'll
do
a
quick
little
cabin
just
creep
out
a
basic
sheet
for
the
knife
see
that's
all
you
have
to
do
take
some
Van
Dyck
Brown
little
dark
sienna
mixed
in
it
see
make
the
far
side
of
the
roof
it
will
come
right
down
here
put
in
this
side
of
the
roof
yeah
we'll
put
it
in
the
front
the
other
side
of
the
front
and
we
need
a
little
side
here
and
that
easy
you
got
your
cabin
locked
in
we
take
some
brown
and
white
and
just
barely
touch
it
whisper
light
just
let
this
float
right
down
this
is
an
old
Kevin
Boyd's
seen
it's
better
day
okay
then
we
can
do
a
cabin
ectomy
cut
it
off
wherever
we
want
it
take
a
little
brown
just
gives
us
a
door
just
sort
of
highlight
that
cutting
through
make
the
indication
of
little
boards
this
whole
cabins
been
deserted
out
here
by
the
trapper
for
many
years
but
maybe
there's
still
a
little
path
here
comes
right
out
like
yes
see
just
little
touch
it
away
then
back
to
our
liquid
white
and
titanium
white
we
come
back
in
here
look
at
that
the
whole
bushes
growing
right
over
the
side
of
that
cabin
nearly
and
you
can
put
bushes
all
up
and
down
where
the
old
paths
used
to
be
he
cuts
his
yard
about
like
I
do
there
we
go
and
you
take
the
knife
just
scrape
in
a
little
stick
in
a
twig
here
and
with
that
I
think
we've
got
a
pretty
good
winter
scene
but
try
this
you'll
like
it
and
from
all
of
us
here
I'd
like
to
wish
you
happy
painting
god
bless
and
I'll
see
you
next
time
you
you
