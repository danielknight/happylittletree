Welcome
back,
I'm
certainly
glad
you
could
join
us
today.
Today
is
the
last
show
of
the
thirty-first
series.
So
let's
start
out
and
have
'em
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
us.
While
they're
doing
that,
let
me
show
you
what
I've
got
done
today.
Today,
I've
taken
my
standard
old
canvas,
and
I
use
an
18
by
24
inch,
but
you
use
whatever
size
is
convenient.
And
I've
taken
a
little
Black
and
Gray
Gesso,
and
a
foam
brush,
just
a
disposable
foam
brush.
And
I've
just
sort
of
painted
in
a
little
scene
here.
To
make
these
little
effects,
I
just
took
a
natural
sponge.
and
just
dobbed
a
little
bit.
That's
all
there
is
to
it.
Let
that
dry
completely,
and
then
we've
covered
the
entire
canvas
with
a
very
thin
coat
of
liquid
clear.
So,
it's
all
wet
and
ready
to
go!
And
I'll
show
you
a
nice
way
of
making
a,
just
a
gorgeous
little
painting,
that's
very
simple.
Let's
start
out
today,
let's
start
with
a
small
amount
of
the
Indian
Yellow.
Don't
need
much,
just
a
little...
On
the
2-inch
brush,
Indian
Yellow
is
very
transparent.
So
we
can
just
paint
right
over
everything.
Doesn't
matter.
Doesn't
matter.
Just
let
it
go
like
something...
There!
Like
that.
That's
all.
Maybe,
little
touch
of
Yellow
Ochre
right
above
it.
just
to
change
the
flavor
a
little
bit
And...
then
I'll
go
into...
a
little
bit
of
the
Bright
Red!
Now,
you
decide,
what
colors
you
want
to
use...
how
strong
you
want
'em
to
be,
or
how
weak.
It's
up
to
you.
Up
to
you.
There!
Something
about
like
that...
maybe
even
a
touch
of
Alizarin
Crimson...
right
up...
like,
there.
But,
just
let
it
go.
And
we're
just
making
little,
little
criss-cross
strokes.
Very
easy.
Oh-kay.
Once
again,
all
these
colors
we're
using
are
transparent
enough
that
you
can
still
see
the
Gesso
right
through
'em.
So,
no
big
deal.
You're
not
gonna
hurt
a
thing.
Just
paint
right
over
anything
that's
in
your
way.
See,
and
already
we
have
a
pretty
nice-looking
little
sky.
Okay,
I
wanna
mix
up,
uh...
we'll
take
some
Phthalo
Blue,
Crimson...
Phthalo
Blue
and
Crimson.
I
wanna
make
a
little
lavender-y
color.
But
I
want
this
to
be
to
the
crimson
side,
so
I
put
many
times
more
crimson
in
it
than
blue.
There.
The
blue
is
much,
much
stronger
than
crimson.
Okay,
now.
let's
take
a
little
bit
of
that
color...
Shoot,
we
didn't
even
have
to
wash
the
brush
yet!
And
we'll
go
right
up
in
here,
and
let's
just
fill
in
the
rest
of
the
sky.
Something
about
like
that.
This
is
just
a
lavender
color,
very
pretty.
And
we're
painting
right
over
Liquid
Clear.
There
we
are.
Be
sure
your
brush
is
dry
and
free
of
paint
thinner
when
you're
doing
this.
Liquid
Clear
and
paint
thinner
have
a
violent
reaction.
So,
you
don't
wanna
put
'em
together.
Be
sure
your
brush
is
as
dry
as
you
can
possibly
get
it.
Oh-kay.
Maybe
just
a
touch
more
of
that.
I
like
that.
There...
Oh-kay.
That
is
a
beautiful
color.
I
like
lavender.
I
really
like
lavender,
purple-
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
Blue
and
crimson,
that's
what
it
is...
Now,
then.
Time
to
wash
the
old
brush.
And
that's
the
part
that's
most
fun.
Mm-kay!
Scrub
the
old
brush
in
odorless
paint
thinner...
and
we'll
take
and
shake
of
the
excess,
*whack
whack
whack
whack
whack
whack*
*laughs*
Beat
the
devil
out
of
it.
Okay,
let's
have
some
fun.
Let's
take
a
little
bit
of
Titanium
Hwite.
I'm
just
gonna
tap
a
little
right
on
to
one
corner
of
the
brush.
That's
all
there
is
to
it.
Just
tap
a
little.
Let's
go
up
in
here.
And
we'll
start
right
at
the
edge
of
this
mountain,
with
that
Titanium
Hwite,
and
begin
working
up.
Now,
Titanium
Hwite
is
very
opaque.
It's
very
opaque.
But,
when
you
have
it
this
thin,
it's
thin
enough
to
still
have
a
little
bit
of
that
show
through.
There.
See?
We
can
pull
it
like
there's
the
sun
rays
coming
through.
There
we
are.
Just
like
it.
See?
Just
gives
the
impression
that
there's
a
beautiful
glow
going
on
back
here.
Okay,
wash
the
old
brush
off...
*whack
whack
whack
whack
whack
whack*
Get
it
good
and
dry.
Now,
then.
Let's
have
some
fun
down
here.
That's
about
all
I'm
going
to
do
for
the
sky.
I
want
this
to
look
like
it's-
just
bathed
in
light.
And
it'll
give
that
impression,
that
easy.
Oh-kay.
Now,
then.
Down
in
here...
gotta
decide
what
we're
gonna
do.
We've
got
some
of
that
lavender
color,
that's
sort
of
pretty.
Let's
just
cover
some
of
this.
Let's
just
cover
it.
A
little
bit
of
that
down
there,
so
we
have
a
base
color.
And
we'll
stop
it
right
along
in
there.
We
don't
want
that
to
get
up
into
the
sky.
Just
put
that
on
there,
that
so
when
we,
when
we
put
highlights
on
all
this,
it'll
pick
up
some
of
that
color.
I
need
to
mix
up
a
little
more.
I
didn't
make
enough.
Phthalo
Blue,
and
Alizarin
Crimson.
And
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
Just,
just
mix
it
up.
Doesn't
have
to
be
well
mixed.
That's
good
enough.
Good
enough.
Now,
there's
a
couple
of
big
old
trees
here.
We
can
go
ahead
and,
sort
of
block
those
in.
See,
the
basic
shape's
already
there.
It
takes
very
little
color,
just
enough
to
create
some
little
arms
on
'im.
And
that's
all
you
need.
Hey,
we'd
better
not
leave
him
out.
He'd
get
upset.
There
we
go.
Something
about
like
that.
Alrighty.
Now,
we've
got
all
of
that
blocked
in...
all
of
it's
covered
with
a
little
bit
of
lavender...
and
we're
ready
to
go.
Have
to
start
making
big
decisions,
now.
There.
Mm-kay!
I'm
gonna
grab
another
old
2-inch
brush,
I've
got
several
of
them
going
here.
Let's
take...
a
little...
Sap
Green,
a
little
of
the
yellow,
little
Yellow
Ochre,
all
those
yellows
mixed
together
with
a
little
Sap
Green.
There,
we'll
just
make
all
kinds
of
beautiful
colors.
Mix
'em
on
the
brush,
though.
Tap,
push.
Give
it
a
little
push.
Okay,
let's
go
up
in
here.
Now
back
in,
back
in
here...
we
wanna
start.
Yeah.
Now,
you
can
do
this
with
a
1-inch
brush,
if
you'd
like.
Can
do
easy.
There,
see?
I
just
want
to
start
putting
the
impression,
of
all
kinds
of
little
duders
that
are
happening
around
in
there.
Just
change
the
flavor
a
little
bit,
every
now
and
then.
Your
dark's
already
there,
so
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
Don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
There's
a
little
tree
that
lives
back
in
there,
these
are
far
away,
just...
little
soft
trees
that
live
back
in
there.
Little
red,
every
now
and
then.
There.
See,
gives
it
sort
of
a-
sort
of
an
autumn
feel.
Alright.
Maybe
over
here,
lives
another
one.
Boy,
there's
one
that's
really
red.
It's
bright
red.
That's
okay.
It's
okay.
In
our
world,
we
can
have
any
color
we
want.
'Cause
we're
the
boss.
We
can
do
it
all.
Alright.
Now,
then.
Let's
start
figuring
out
what's
happening
down
here.
Just
take,
touch...
and
begin
tapping.
Just
begin
tapping.
It's
picking
up
that
color,
that
we
put
on
the
canvas,
underneath,
there.
And
the
more
you
tap
it,
the
more
it'll
pick
it
up
and
the
color
will
just
get
darker
and
darker,
automatically.
So,
you
have
to
make
the
big
decision
how
dark
you
want
it
to
be.
I'm
just
varying
some
of
the
colors,
when
I
go
away.
Putting
on
a
little
bit
of
the
yellows,
and...
the
greens.
But
think
about
the
lay
of
the
land.
The
way
the
land
flows.
I
want
the
land
to
look
like
it's
coming,
like
that.
So
that's
what
we'll
do.
And
if
you
have
trouble
making
it
stick,
add
a
little
bit
of
paint
thinner,
before
you
go
through
the
paint.
To
load
your
brush.
Let
me
repeat
one
word
in
there,
though:
little.
It
takes
very,
very
little.
Don't
put
much
in
there.
Little
goes
a
long,
long
way!
Long,
long
way.
'Kay.
Well,
lookit
there!
Lookit
there!
Isn't
that
neat?
You
can
do
this.
You
really,
and
truly,
can
do
it.
Little
practice,
off
you
go.
Shoot.
Now,
look,
they
already
have
a
lot
of
depth.
Lot
of
depth.
I
know
what
I'll-
I'm
gonna-
let
me
show
ya,
let
me
show
ya.
I'm
sorry,
I
get
excited
sometimes.
I
wanna
pull
this
tree
down.
now
you're
saying
"Bob,
you've
really
cracked
up,"
now.
But
watch.
I
know
it's
hard
to
see
against
all
that
dark,
but
I've
decided
that
tree
should
be
in
the
foreground!
We
had
him
in
the
background,
and
we
moved
him.
'Cause
in
our
world,
we
can
move
trees,
we
can
bend
rivers.
Anything
that
we
wanna
do.
There.
See?
All
kinds
of
little
duders.
I
didn't
paint
over
here
very
well,
so...
we'll
just
put
a
tree
there,
sort
of-
fill
that
hole
up.
Trees
are
wonderful
for
that.
There
we
go!
Hey,
looks
like
a
little
meadow
back
here,
now.
Okay.
Just
let
your
imagination
take
you,
to
any
land
that
you
want
to
live
in.
Any
place
that
you
want
to
go.
Alright!
Shoot,
that's
looking
pretty
good,
there!
Let's
take
our
little
script
liner
brush.
We'll
take
a
little
brown...
little
brown...
let
me
put
a
little
Hwite
over
there,
too.
Now
we
got
a
little
Brown,
little
Hwite.
I'll
make
a,
a
very
thin,
thin
paint,
here.
Very
thin.
Okay,
maybe
I'll
even
put
in
a
little
Black,
too.
To
gray
it.
Oh,
that's
perfect.
'Kay,
let's
go
up
in
here.
Now,
in
our
world...
there's
an
old
tree
trunk
in
there.
Now,
if
your
hand's
a
little
nervous
and
you
got
a
little
shake,
this
is
the
time
to
use
it.
That
way,
you
don't
end
up
with
just
a
plain,
ol'...
trunk
in
your
tree.
Put
something
there
that's
got
some,
some
interest
to
it.
And
then
we're
gonna
cover
most
of
it
up
with
leaves.
But,
some
of
it'll
show.
Some
of
it
will
show.
This
old
tree
says
"I
want
one,
too!"
There.
See,
you
decide.
You
decide...
where
they
are.
There.
Maybe
your,
maybe
your
tree
don't
even
have
any
trunk
in
it.
Maybe
you
can't
see
it.
We
know
it
has
it,
but
maybe
you
can't
see
it.
That's
up
to
you,
too.
Any
way...
that
you
want
it
to
be...
is
just
right.
There.
Maybe
we'll
give
him
one
more
little
arm.
One
over
here
to
hold
up
that
whole,
that
whole
area.
Alright!
Now,
then.
Let's
begin
to
figure
out
where
these
little
trees
are.
Take
a
little...
of
the
yellow,
little
Sap
Green...
Every
once
in
a
while
I'm
gonna
touch
it
with
a
little
bit
of
red.
'Kay,
let's
go
up
in
here.
Let's
do
this
one.
Yeah.
Start
right
up
in
here,
and
just
begin
putting
in
the
impression
of
some
little
leaves
on
there
that
live
right
out
in
there.
Right
out
there.
A
little
more
paint
on
the
brush...
There
we
are.
Don't
be
afraid
to
stop
and
load
the
brush
frequently.
Just
like
we
do
here.
Sometimes
you
have
to
load
it
several
times
during
one
tree.
That's
okay.
That's
okay.
We're
not
in
any
hurry.
Well,
Im
in
a
hurry
(Laughts)
=
LAvth.
As
you
know,
I
got
a
Meno
director
back
here
There
we
are.
I
should
talk
about
my
Meno
Director
a
little
bit.
She's
really.
A
very
nice
person.
And,
I
pick
On
her
Because
She
deserves.
Hmm....
This
whole
crew
here
Where
we
filmed
the
Show.
Some
of
the
best
people
I've
Ever
met.
And
I'd
like
to
thank
them.
I
don't
do
that
often
enough.
because
Without
him.
there
would
be
no
joy
of
painting.
They
are
the
best.
There
we
are.
see
got
a
little
happy
tree
right
there
right
there
let's
go
over
here.
you're
home
.
Change
the
flavor
a
little
a
little
red
in
there.
FUCKING
BOB
ROSS
PERSONS.
