I
was
certainly
glad
to
see
you
again
today
and
let's
do
a
fantastic
little
painting
you
know
in
each
series
you
got
to
have
you
got
to
have
a
day
that's
a
little
crazy
and
this
is
my
crazy
day
and
I've
got
something
a
little
different
up
here
today
I've
got
a
black
canvas
here
as
you
can
see
but
I
found
some
taper
later
on
the
studio
here
and
I've
just
run
some
tape
around
the
edges
and
then
I've
covered
the
whole
entire
part
of
this
canvas
with
a
mixture
of
phthalo
blue
and
SAP
green
and
just
just
a
thin
even
coat
all
the
way
over
and
we
make
these
black
canvasses
by
painting
them
with
black
gesso
which
is
designed
specifically
to
make
these
canvases
this
way
the
gesso
is
allowed
to
dry
completely
and
then
onto
that
we
put
a
transparent
paint
and
we
don't
let
that
dry
we
start
painting
on
it
while
the
transparent
paint
is
still
wet
so
I
tell
you
what
let's
have
them
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
and
as
they
start
that
let's
go
on
up
here
and
get
started
on
on
this
old
canvas
this
is
a
fun
painting
think
you
really
like
this
what
a
lot
of
fun
I'm
gonna
start
today
Oh
fan
brush
and
titanium
white
just
load
a
little
color
into
the
brush
both
sides
like
so
like
so
let's
go
up
here
now
then
let's
say
this
is
our
crazy
day
so
just
take
the
brush
and
just
let
it
spin
just
have
fun
with
it
and
let
it
go
anywhere
it
wants
to
go
wherever
just
make
all
kinds
of
little
things
and
see
it's
beginning
to
pick
up
that
color
that's
on
the
canvas
the
transparent
color
it's
still
wet
keep
the
brush
movie
so
you
get
all
kinds
of
different
little
designs
I
told
you
this
wouldn't
be
fun
and
you
can't
make
a
mistake
here
this
is
this
is
enjoyable
load
the
brush
as
it
needs
paint
and
there's
not
a
great
deal
of
paint
on
the
canvas
you
really
don't
need
a
lot
of
paint
push
that
brush
in
there
bend
it
just
get
all
those
little
actions
oh
tons
of
nice
little
things
we'll
put
one
right
up
here
to
what
the
heck
saying
you
have
to
sort
of
make
a
decision
here
maybe
maybe
it'll
come
down
about
that
far
now
then
we
can
wash
her
wash
your
little
fan
brush
would
just
wash
it
with
odorless
dinner
and
wipe
it
on
a
paper
towel
that's
all
you
have
to
do
okay
now
then
let
me
find
a
big
brush
make
sure
it's
good
and
dry
and
I'm
very
gently
here
just
gently
I'm
gonna
blend
this
watch
here
just
put
it
just
sort
of
paint
up
and
down
on
it
like
so
it's
all
there
is
to
it
right
now
right
now
you
saying
Bob
you
have
really
done
it
this
time
maybe
so
maybe
so
there
look
how
color
shows
up
on
these
black
canvases
off
really
fantastic
all
right
now
then
I
go
back
and
get
the
fan
brush
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
midnight
black
just
straight
old
midnight
black
same
old
fan
brush
load
a
lot
of
color
into
it
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
now
then
I
want
to
make
the
indication
of
some
little
distant
trees
that
are
far
back
in
the
woods
so
we
just
take
the
fan
brush
and
just
tap
just
tap
it
makes
those
edges
nice
and
fuzzy
evergreen
trees
and
I
have
have
sort
of
fuzzy
edges
and
you
decide
how
many
trees
you
want
back
here
wherever
you
want
them
just
drop
them
in
maybe
there's
one
right
there
shoot
let's
go
over
here
there's
one
and
let's
sum
up
have
little
crooks
out
don't
make
them
all
exactly
straight
cause
trees
grow
over
which
way
however
makes
them
happy
maybe
yep
you're
right
let's
have
another
one
right
there
wherever
wherever
maybe
maybe
there's
one
over
here
like
so
see
and
you
can
you
can
really
put
just
as
many
or
as
few
well
maybe
they're
crowded
here
I
think
this
is
a
condominium
for
trees
here
they
got
a
whole
bunch
of
them
there
okay
now
we'll
take
our
little
number
to
script
liner
brush
I'm
going
to
dip
it
into
paint
thinner
to
get
the
paint
very
thin
almost
the
consistency
of
ink
turn
that
brush
bring
it
to
a
sharp
point
can
out
it
let's
go
up
here
and
just
put
the
indication
here
and
there
of
a
few
little
branches
hanging
off
these
distant
trees
just
a
few
just
a
few
just
sort
of
decide
or
you
think
they
should
be
and
drop
them
in
now
if
your
paint
doesn't
flow
chances
are
you
need
more
paint
thinner
on
this
paint
on
this
good
and
thin
will
literally
flow
right
off
your
brush
well
literally
flow
there
at
home
you
can
put
as
many
little
limbs
on
whose
you
want
I
just
won't
put
if
you
want
to
show
you
how
their
dad
they
only
give
me
about
30
minutes
here
to
do
this
and
if
I
don't
get
it
done
in
that
amount
of
time
Sally
comes
out
here
and
yells
at
me
she's
a
director
picks
on
me
yeah
there
we
go
I
have
no
sense
of
humor
around
here
if
you
don't
get
done
in
half
an
hour
there
okay
and
we'll
put
a
few
over
here
wherever
just
to
show
but
that
quick
and
that
easy
you
can
make
the
indication
of
a
whole
forest
see
there
looks
like
all
kinds
of
little
trees
we
back
in
the
woods
way
back
here
hmm
I
like
these
kind
of
little
scenes
they're
a
lot
of
fun
to
do
extremely
easy
extremely
and
they
work
for
you
there
we
have
our
little
forest
that
quick
okay
they
have
it
they
find
a
good
dry
2
inch
brush
and
let's
begin
putting
some
little
grassy
areas
in
here
I'm
going
to
start
tell
you
what
let's
use
a
little
bit
of
CAD
yellow
some
Indian
yellow
some
yellow
ochre
I'll
be
right
back
we
reach
up
and
get
a
little
SAP
green
too
so
now
we
get
all
the
yellows
and
SAP
green
and
just
tap
the
brush
like
so
there's
not
a
great
deal
of
paint
on
the
brush
just
look
up
there
now
then
you
have
to
make
some
big
decisions
maybe
there's
a
little
bit
of
land
back
here
so
you
decide
how
the
land
the
lay
of
the
land
say
just
touch
and
comes
right
down
see
there
how
easy
that
it
all
you
doing
is
just
touching
and
it
makes
this
beautiful
soft
looks
like
it
looks
like
velvet
grass
out
here
it's
just
so
nice
be
a
super
place
just
to
run
barefooted
there
we
go
I
was
born
raised
in
Florida
and
you
run
barefooted
a
lot
there
on
and
I
was
a
kid
everybody
was
barefooted
I
had
to
watch
out
for
the
sands
pers
oh
that's
a
plant
that
grows
it
had
little
ooh
they
hurt
your
foots
there
people
in
Florida
know
what
that
is
over
here
will
come
like
this
just
however
okay
and
we
just
keep
working
down
down
down
yeah
when
I
was
a
kid
growing
up
in
the
Florida
I
had
all
kinds
of
pets
I've
always
been
a
creature
net
I
love
all
the
little
creatures
and
I
had
every
kind
of
pet
from
alligators
to
lizards
snakes
maybe
that
maybe
the
word
is
pet
overhead
in
school
I
grew
up
in
the
country
and
I
took
like
I
think
it
was
called
4-h
and
Future
Farmers
of
America
and
in
there
you
you
had
to
you
had
to
have
a
project
you
had
a
garden
or
some
kind
of
something
and
you
you
kept
records
of
it
showed
how
you
made
money
it
was
like
having
a
small
business
and
it
taught
kids
how
to
do
things
a
super
program
but
anyway
I
picked
I've
picked
chickens
I
decided
I
was
gonna
raise
chickens
well
the
thing
was
you
had
to
go
get
some
little
chicks
and
you
raised
him
up
until
they
were
full-grown
then
you
had
to
knock
him
in
the
head
and
sell
him
well
I
think
you
know
what
happened
already
the
chickens
grew
up
and
they
became
my
friends
and
I
was
doing
real
good
had
good
grades
why
I
had
real
good
grades
until
it
come
time
to
knock
him
in
the
head
and
I
couldn't
do
that
so
I
didn't
do
too
good
in
that
class
I
talk
too
much
let
me
keep
going
here
they're
all
we're
doing
is
putting
in
all
these
little
soft
grassy
areas
wherever
you
want
but
my
chickens
live
to
be
a
ripe
old
age
there
okay
so
I
didn't
make
a
good
chicken
farmer
I
feel
that
got
a
e'en
chicken
farm
tell
you
alright
let's
take
a
little
bit
of
titanium
white
on
the
fan
brush
here
a
little
bit
of
titanium
white
and
I
have
several
fan
brushes
going
so
I
don't
have
to
continually
clean
them
let's
go
right
up
here
and
this
is
just
a
beautiful
place
to
have
a
bubbling
little
stream
so
decide
where
you
want
your
little
stream
to
live
maybe
he
lives
right
here
and
I
start
right
here
and
there
he
comes
blue
sea
look
how
color
stands
out
though
on
this
black
canvas
give
a
little
push
here
and
there
and
comes
on
maybe
there's
little
stones
and
stuff
all
underneath
here
in
little
places
where
the
water
splashes
and
hits
and
crashes
and
comes
down
make
up
little
stories
there
you
go
there
see
look
at
that
see
a
little
stream
just
just
meanders
around
down
there
I
think
that's
a
word
if
it's
not
you
know
what
I
mean
there
we
go
see
the
rest
of
that
story
about
the
chickens
I
had
to
go
on
with
this
to
this
day
though
I
don't
eat
chicken
these
things
became
my
friends
and
to
this
day
I
won't
eat
anything
that
ever
had
feathers
on
it
there
look
at
that
little
stream
see
has
just
it
just
grows
right
there
in
your
fan
brush
lives
our
hides
there
just
wherever
you
want
it
to
go
there
we
do
a
lot
of
shows
around
the
country
for
charity
groups
and
PBS
stations
and
etc
and
the
thing
that
that
most
people
say
when
I
finally
get
to
meet
them
in
person
the
first
thing
they
always
say
is
son
of
a
gun
you're
a
lot
taller
and
you
look
on
TV
and
you
don't
have
red
hair
I
don't
have
red
hair
and
I'm
almost
6
foot
2
and
if
you've
seen
Steve
my
son
on
the
show
that
little
son
of
a
gun
is
almost
six
five
now
so
he's
he
calls
me
shorty
I'm
going
to
take
a
little
bit
of
bad
luck
Brown
a
little
dark
Santa
mixed
together
and
hearing
they're
hearing
a
let's
go
right
up
here
and
let's
just
put
the
indication
of
some
land
little
stones
and
stuff
up
through
here
wherever
you
think
they
should
be
wherever
wherever
you
just
sort
of
you
sort
of
decide
where
you
want
to
put
them
in
maybe
tell
you
what
let's
do
maybe
right
here
got
something
right
there
I'm
just
putting
in
a
little
color
maybe
right
over
here
okay
they
would
take
some
white
a
little
bit
of
dark
Sienna
just
the
least
little
bit
of
the
dark
see
and
I
just
a
tiny
bit
now
they
find
out
if
you
got
delicate
touch
just
let
this
barely
just
graze
its
barely
touch
do
you
see
how
that
color
stands
out
them
on
these
black
canvases
it's
fantastic
just
jumps
right
out
at
you
hmm
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
things
that
easy
head
back
here
where
we
had
these
little
stones
I'll
put
a
little
touch
of
highlight
on
them
Kenny
and
in
your
painting
you
put
this
wherever
you
want
it
wherever
you
want
it
and
we
can
take
a
fan
brush
a
little
bit
of
that
green
and
yellow
on
it
just
load
it
back
just
back
and
forth
like
yeah
okay
and
then
we
come
up
here
and
very
carefully
we
can
just
drop
in
some
of
the
grassy
things
around
that
around
the
individual
rocks
and
the
water
just
just
give
it
a
little
upward
push
a
little
upward
push
wherever
and
we'll
get
the
small
knife
may
be
right
out
here
lives
a
big
rock
it
projects
up
right
there
a
big
old
Sun
oh
my
god
and
we'll
put
a
touch
of
highlight
on
him
just
a
touch
like
so
big
little
strong
rock
all
right
put
the
least
little
touch
of
the
liquid
white
in
with
my
titanium
white
the
liquid
white
we'll
just
make
it
a
little
thinner
so
it
so
it
flows
a
little
easier
liquid
white
titanium
or
that
maybe
now
you
got
to
think
like
water
maybe
the
water
just
comes
right
around
here
and
it
comes
here
and
son
of
a
gun
somebody
has
pulled
a
stopper
out
June
and
it
falls
right
off
there
so
come
over
and
down
see
there
how
easy
it
is
this
water
here
splashes
and
long
and
it
comes
out
here
hmm
and
maybe
under
here
there's
a
little
stone
hits
and
true
if
you
don't
make
those
little
noises
so
it
don't
work
go
ahead
and
make
those
little
noises
like
so
that
neat
in
this
super
easy
way
to
make
a
beautiful
little
water
falling
down
here
it
hits
and
splashes
and
churns
and
oh
look
at
all
that
push
upward
with
a
brush
making
little
splashes
happen
here
it
comes
waters
a
rough
town
here
it's
off
fell
all
the
way
down
there
say
there
then
deep
and
it
we
need
something
in
here
so
I'll
go
back
to
mode
2
inch
brush
they
had
all
the
yellows
on
it
a
little
touch
the
bright
red
every
now
and
then
not
much
just
tap
the
brush
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
then
we
want
to
bring
some
of
these
grassy
areas
right
down
over
the
stones
get
a
little
more
green
in
that
a
little
more
of
the
SAP
green
here
it
comes
see
that
these
little
things
just
hang
right
off
like
it
you
don't
want
to
cover
up
all
your
little
little
rocks
or
that
are
showing
leave
some
of
them
leave
a
few
of
them
there
a
little
bit
more
of
a
color
that
comes
just
follow
the
angles
that
you
put
in
here
for
all
of
those
angles
there
you
ever
believed
you
could
paint
such
delicate
little
grassy
areas
using
a
great
big
brush
you
really
can't
do
it
again
there
so
it
looks
like
all
that
i'll
little
moss
and
grassy
stuff
it
always
hangs
around
a
waterfall
cause
the
humidity
so
how
you
get
all
kinds
of
little
hanging
down
plants
little
hanging
down
plants
this
is
a
nice
place
my
mother
would
like
a
place
like
this
she
likes
these
quiet
little
places
where
the
water
please
there
we
go
see
they're
just
layer
after
layer
tell
you
what
let's
do
there
it
is
I
lost
my
brush
let's
have
some
fun
I'm
moving
right
up
to
the
Van
Dyck
Brown
with
a
fan
brush
just
load
it
full
of
paint
load
it
full
reach
over
here
and
get
some
black
too
so
we
got
black
midnight
black
Van
Dyck
brown
walnut
very
dark
let's
go
out
here
maybe
I
like
old
big
trees
hmm
so
we'll
put
one
right
there
big
ole
tree
bagel
tree
and
he's
he's
got
a
friend
we
just
cover
that
one
right
up
boy
we
just
kill
that
tree
back
here
didn't
we
that's
all
right
that's
all
right
if
you
learn
how
to
make
him
then
the
effort
wasn't
wasted
wasn't
wasted
a
little
more
paint
on
the
brush
we
need
another
one
we
need
a
big
tree
and
he
lives
oh
boy
this
is
a
big
tree
put
some
put
some
crooks
anyway
no
wanting
to
straighten
let
him
just
flow
right
off
your
brush
he
sets
out
here
and
watches
a
little
waterfall
put
him
a
root
coming
out
down
there
yeah
his
jobs
to
watch
the
waterfall
okay
now
then
I
won't
take
some
titanium
point
and
get
a
little
bit
of
bright
red
just
a
little
bit
it's
very
strong
be
careful
it's
easy
to
get
too
much
pull
it
out
very
flat
and
we
wipe
the
knife
off
here
then
cut
across
and
we
get
our
little
roll
of
paint
right
out
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
here
okay
now
then
let's
put
some
highlights
on
these
big
trees
let's
touch
give
it
a
little
tiny
pull
not
much
just
barely
pull
and
it's
let
it
sort
of
blend
back
there
we
go
just
wherever
wherever
wherever
there
see
darker
darker
darker
as
it
works
or
his
way
around
the
tree
if
you
start
on
that
outside
edge
and
just
keep
working
around
that'll
happen
automatically
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
it
or
anything
else
it'll
happen
just
let
it
go
list
with
some
of
these
other
trees
back
here
too
we
went
down
left
out
touch
just
touch
follow
the
tree
right
I
don't
have
to
like
so
like
so
you
know
it
ever
since
we've
introduced
these
these
canvases
I
think
the
first
one
I
did
in
the
series
was
an
oval
and
that
has
become
one
of
the
most
popular
things
we've
ever
done
all
the
different
shapes
and
designs
that
can
be
made
here
they're
almost
there's
no
limit
to
him
there's
absolutely
no
limit
oh
my
friend
Nat
Canada
you
would
see
some
of
the
things
he's
making
all
kinds
of
octagons
so
it
just
goes
on
and
on
let's
just
let
your
imagination
go
contact
paperwork's
very
good
and
just
cut
out
a
design
stick
it
right
on
there
paint
your
picture
and
pull
it
off
you
can't
believe
some
of
the
effects
I
mix
a
little
they
little
blue
and
white
here
and
I'm
gonna
get
just
a
small
amount
and
just
put
a
little
touch
on
the
back
of
the
tree
just
to
indicate
a
little
reflected
light
there
it's
like
some
a
little
bit
on
these
other
trees
there
we
go
now
then
we
go
back
we
pick
up
a
little
bit
of
Van
Dyck
Brown
and
go
right
back
in
the
middle
and
just
tap
a
little
all
you're
doing
is
tapping
let
let
the
canvas
pull
off
what
it
wants
give
you
back
what's
left
just
like
my
taxman
does
there's
nothing
left
Hurley
when
he
gets
finished
they're
like
so
now
when
these
when
these
trees
dry
they'll
have
texture
they'll
feel
like
they'll
feel
like
real
bark
okay
take
our
liner
brush
paint
thinner
and
thinner
we'll
use
some
black
and
brown
get
dark
color
we
want
this
to
be
thin
like
ink
see
they're
too
running
you
can
see
it
running
okay
load
some
paint
on
there
let's
go
up
here
add
it
let's
come
right
down
in
here
and
put
some
nice
big
strong
arms
on
these
trees
tree
needs
an
arm
to
hold
up
the
weight
of
the
forest
but
a
bird
has
to
have
a
place
to
sit
there
there
it
goes
there
he
goes
in
this
old
tree
here
a
gold
branch
comes
out
here
on
out
here
cross
so
you
just
however
many
you
want
okay
can't
get
a
little
more
thinner
let's
do
this
old
big
tree
here
maybe
there's
a
big
old
limb
there
it
is
comes
right
down
my
cab
I
don't
down
one
I
hear
wherever
you
want
to
just
sort
of
look
at
your
tree
and
your
painting
and
decide
where
you
think
the
limbs
it'd
be
would
be
right
there
we
go
there's
why
he
goes
on
across
the
tree
wherever
if
these
are
evergreen
trees
there's
always
a
lot
of
old
dead
looking
films
that
hang
out
wherever
always
a
lot
of
them
okay
tell
you
what
let's
use
the
US
use
the
oval
brush
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
black
reach
over
here
now
grab
a
little
SAP
green
just
mix
them
on
a
brush
shoot
black
SAP
green
tap
some
color
into
the
bristles
go
right
up
in
here
and
we'll
just
put
the
indication
that
oval
brush
makes
all
those
beautiful
little
little
leave
the
effects
very
easy
all
you
do
is
just
tap
downward
but
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
in
there
this
is
green
and
black
green
and
black
very
dark
there
all
those
little
hangy
downs
okay
let's
go
the
other
tree
over
here
put
some
right
here
like
so
I
think
so
okay
wherever
wherever
okay
now
I
have
another
little
oval
brush
going
here
two
of
them
in
with
that
one
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
some
CAD
yellow
and
I
reach
up
here
and
grab
a
little
black
and
make
a
nice
green
load
the
brush
full
of
paint
full
of
paint
and
when
you
after
you
pull
it
once
you
pull
it
and
then
give
a
little
push
had
loads
of
paint
right
on
the
tip
okay
now
there
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
go
in
here
and
lay
some
highlights
on
these
trees
some
bright
colors
don't
overdo
don't
overdo
is
too
dark
there
it's
super
it's
a
nice
way
of
making
some
very
effective
little
evergreen
trees
this
one
here
give
him
a
few
just
however
many
you
want
it
sort
of
look
at
the
basic
patterns
here
don't
just
throw
him
on
at
random
we
talked
about
that
a
little
bit
over
sure
he's
got
a
personality
don't
to
hurt
his
feelings
okay
it's
a
big
old
tree
out
here
didn't
have
a
super
nice
easy
way
to
make
some
very
effective
little
evergreens
there
we
are
okay
here
at
up
in
here
shoot
look
at
that
all
kinds
of
little
things
happening
there
all
right
time
to
have
some
fun
now
I'm
gonna
pull
the
tape
off
here
let's
see
what
we
have
okay
let's
bring
the
camera
right
up
here
and
watch
here
that's
right
here
here
it
comes
yeah
just
take
it
right
off
and
what
do
they
say
fool
our
whatever
it
is
got
a
fantastic
little
painting
right
there
but
I
like
I
like
these
kind
of
paintings
because
you
can
run
outside
of
the
borders
now
let's
let's
take
our
stream
here
and
let's
just
let
this
little
stream
just
wander
right
on
out
of
the
borders
let
it
go
for
a
waste
let
it
go
for
a
waste
I
don't
want
it
captured
in
there
just
let
it
go
see
push
up
like
little
commies
and
they're
just
wandering
right
on
off
the
canvas
I
don't
know
okay
then
we
can
go
back
to
Big
O
2
inch
brush
and
maybe
look
at
there
we
can
bring
this
land
area
right
on
down
just
sort
of
let
it
wander
right
on
out

I
love
the
way

little
pictures
