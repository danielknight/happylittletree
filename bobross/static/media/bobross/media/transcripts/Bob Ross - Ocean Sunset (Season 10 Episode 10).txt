hi
glad
to
see
you
again
today
you're
into
a
fantastic
seascape
thought
that's
what
we'd
do
today
so
let's
start
out
and
have
them
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
do
this
seascape
with
me
and
that's
going
up
here
let
me
talk
just
a
little
bit
while
they're
doing
that
I
started
with
a
good
old
standard
18
by
24
inch
canvas
but
I've
done
something
a
little
bit
different
today
the
top
part
of
the
canvas
is
totally
covered
with
a
thin
even
coat
of
liquid
white
all
the
way
up
here
down
you
can
see
this
little
line
here
now
from
here
down
is
covered
with
liquid
clear
now
this
is
just
like
liquid
white
only
it's
clear
that's
all
so
let's
go
and
do
a
fantastic
little
seascape
I'm
going
to
start
out
with
a
two
inch
brush
and
a
small
small
amount
of
the
CAD
yellow
very
small
amount
just
beat
it
into
the
bristles
a
little
bit
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
then
maybe
we'll
have
a
beautiful
bright
little
sky
today
so
I'm
just
going
to
start
with
a
little
yellow
do
something
like
so
just
let
that
mix
with
the
liquid
white
there
now
without
cleaning
the
brush
we're
right
into
a
touch
of
yellow
ocher
load
the
brush
the
same
way
go
back
up
here
now
right
around
the
edges
of
that
see
there
still
use
the
little
crisscross
strokes
we'll
just
bring
that
right
around
sort
of
like
so
there
we
go
and
if
a
little
happens
to
get
down
here
in
your
painting
don't
worry
about
it
don't
worry
about
it
it's
no
problem
at
all
okay
still
without
cleaning
the
brush
we'll
go
right
into
bright
red
a
little
bit
some
very
strong
okay
right
around
those
ages
I
would
take
a
little
bit
of
this
beautiful
red
color
just
like
so
but
pretty
already
we
have
a
we
have
a
painting
for
the
Museum
of
Modern
Art
here
we
can
just
stop
right
there
now
that
I
want
to
put
a
little
bit
of
red
over
here
and
just
let
it
work
right
along
right
in
here
is
gonna
be
the
horizon
there
we
go
and
we're
just
very
lightly
blend
all
this
together
okay
now
then
I
have
several
brushes
going
son
I'd
spend
all
my
time
washing
I'm
gonna
take
straight
titanium
white
just
straight
white
and
go
right
up
in
this
area
and
I
want
this
to
be
very
brightest
I'm
gonna
take
white
and
put
it
right
there
straight
titanium
point
now
it
won't
show
up
much
because
light
against
light
is
nothing
but
you
just
wait
I'm
gonna
grab
it
and
pull
it
just
pull
look
at
this
grab
it
and
pull
we
don't
care
what
happens
in
here
we're
gonna
cover
all
that
up
anyway
now
then
let
me
wash
your
brush
and
we
just
wash
our
brushes
with
odorless
paint
thinner
shake
them
off
and
beat
the
devil
out
of
okay
we
can
just
use
this
same
old
brush
I'm
gonna
go
into
a
small
amount
of
phthalo
blue
and
reach
up
here
and
grab
a
little
touch
of
alizarin
crimson
so
we
have
phthalo
blue
and
alizarin
crimson
proportionately
much
more
crimson
than
blue
I
want
this
to
be
a
little
bit
to
the
reddish
side
okay
there's
a
very
little
paint
on
the
brush
let's
go
back
up
here
and
let's
take
use
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
using
little
circular
little
circular
strokes
and
let's
just
begin
laying
in
some
happy
little
clouds
maybe
there's
one
that
lives
oh
look
there
look
at
that
there
he
is
see
comes
right
ahead
out
there
look
at
that
see
how
easy
it
is
to
make
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
cloud
shapes
all
you
need
is
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
there
we
go
okay
now
then
over
here
we'll
put
him
had
a
little
cloud
Liz
right
there
there
we
go
and
in
your
world
you
decide
where
the
clouds
live
and
you
put
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
want
cheery
decision
there
we
go
just
wherever
maybe
there's
one
right
there
still
using
those
tiny
little
strokes
little
circular
strokes
just
with
a
corner
of
the
brush
okay
let's
say
I
have
I
have
several
brushes
going
here
now
with
a
clean
brush
I'm
just
gonna
very
gently
blend
this
a
little
don't
have
to
over
blend
it
just
enough
to
sort
of
mix
it
up
like
so
there
we
go
still
using
little
round
strokes
little
circular
strokes
you
can
blend
this
till
it
absolutely
goes
away
all
we
want
to
do
is
blend
it
just
enough
to
soften
the
edges
so
it
comes
already
mint
watch
here
then
we'll
take
this
and
very
gently
three
hairs
and
some
air
very
gently
just
bring
it
all
together
you
don't
want
to
lose
your
shapes
I
just
want
to
soften
all
the
edges
and
then
you
can
do
like
Katniss
the
head
just
brings
it
right
over
makes
it
look
like
little
light
streaks
coming
through
there
now
then
to
really
add
a
little
more
contrast
I'm
gonna
mix
a
little
more
color
the
same
color
crimson
and
phthalo
blue
those
room
crimson
phthalo
blue
with
a
little
darker
a
little
more
on
the
brush
and
right
in
here
I
want
to
show
a
cloud
that's
a
little
closer
so
for
that
we'll
just
use
a
little
darker
color
and
it'll
give
the
impression
that
this
cloud
is
closer
to
us
see
how
easy
that
is
you
can
create
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
things
happening
in
here
all
right
then
we'll
go
back
to
our
clean
brush
stir
this
up
a
little
bit
just
mix
it
don't
over
to
dawn
/
-
it's
easy
to
get
carried
away
and
then
very
lightly
-
hair
is
in
sumeria
this
time
see
it
gives
the
impression
now
that
that
cloud
is
in
front
a
little
bit
so
it
helps
creep
the
illusion
of
depth
and
distance
in
your
sky
and
you
can
put
a
couple
hair
in
there
wherever
but
that
easy
you
can
make
a
fantastic
fantastic
sky
looks
like
a
nice
sunset
already
and
if
you
if
you
want
to
you
can
go
in
here
with
a
fan
brush
and
you
can
add
some
little
streakers
hmm
little
streaky
clouds
so
that
easy
and
you
can
put
as
many
of
these
in
as
you
want
just
want
to
show
you
how
clean
dry
brush
and
then
blend
them
right
into
the
painting
there
we
go
and
that
a
beautiful
sky
and
you
can
do
it
there
wash
it
then
brush
I
have
some
paper
towels
over
here
I
just
dry
the
fan
brush
on
that's
the
fun
part
of
this
whole
technique
already
now
then
we
have
to
make
a
big
decision
here
let's
take
let's
take
let's
take
let's
take
our
phthalo
blue
alizarin
crimson
and
I'm
going
to
make
a
dark
dark
lavender
color
on
the
palette
it
should
look
black
all
right
we
got
our
mixed
here
now
then
probably
let
me
show
you
one
other
thing
first
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
help
you
with
the
seascape
because
they're
sort
of
hard
at
first
till
you
practice
a
little
I'm
going
to
take
the
little
filbert
brush
here
and
to
that
I've
added
a
bunch
of
paint
thinner
so
this
is
thin
as
water
nearly
sort
of
sort
of
come
in
here
and
sketch
out
where
you
want
the
major
wave
to
be
and
let's
just
say
it's
gonna
live
boom
right
there
and
this
is
not
a
commitment
at
this
time
you
can
still
change
it
soon
comes
up
like
it
may
be
it
comes
over
may
be
the
foams
gonna
crash
up
in
here
somewhere
like
that
now
our
shoreline
maybe
it'll
come
oh
I
get
something
like
it
that
just
helps
give
you
a
little
bit
of
sort
of
a
layout
and
it'll
really
save
you
a
lot
of
trouble
okay
after
you
practiced
a
while
maybe
you
don't
need
to
do
this
but
at
first
I
really
recommend
you
do
it
that
way
too
it'll
help
you
lay
it
out
here
I'm
using
that
dark
color
we
made
it's
a
very
dark
lavender
color
see
if
we've
we
had
used
liquid
white
here
and
we
put
this
on
it
would
pick
up
the
white
and
you
would
lose
this
beautiful
beautiful
dark
color
there
liquid
clear
allows
us
to
mix
on
the
canvas
without
changing
the
value
of
the
color
look
at
that
we'll
just
come
right
on
down
in
here
in
here
we're
going
to
have
the
transparency
or
the
or
the
bright
spot
of
the
wave
that's
the
part
of
the
wave
if
you
into
selling
paintings
that's
the
part
of
the
wave
it
sells
that's
what
everybody
wants
to
see
that
big
big
crasher
hook
them
right
in
here
hmm
just
sort
of
all
of
this
guide
are
we
doing
here
is
putting
in
some
dark
color
so
our
light
will
show
later
on
that
may
add
a
little
more
color
a
little
more
color
let's
repentant
phthalo
blue
now
when
you're
doing
these
at
home
you
can
add
all
kinds
of
colors
the
other
times
they'll
greens
very
pretty
and
seascapes
ooh
it
is
dynamite
color
beautiful
color
it's
very
strong
be
careful
with
it
see
already
we
have
all
of
our
dark
areas
blocked
in
when
you're
using
a
big
old
2
inch
brush
you
didn't
take
but
a
second
ok
in
that
a
beautiful
rich
color
all
right
now
we
can
really
start
playing
let
me
grab
my
fan
brush
I'm
gonna
take
same
old
colors
alizarin
crimson
and
phthalo
blue
let's
head
let's
put
some
on
the
fan
brush
here
just
load
it
back
and
forth
like
yet
not
a
great
deal
of
paint
on
the
brush
okay
let's
go
up
here
maybe
there's
a
little
footling
back
here
that's
a
fancy
name
for
a
rock
sticks
out
in
the
water
a
little
Peninsula
we
back
in
the
distance
and
this
is
too
far
away
to
show
detail
so
don't
worry
about
it
all
we're
looking
for
here
it's
just
a
basic
shape
Kenny
tell
you
what
-
that
was
so
much
fun
this
-
another
one
maybe
there's
another
bigger
stone
in
front
of
it
here
bigger
foot
but
this
will
help
create
the
illusion
of
distance
in
your
painting
and
you
can
put
all
kind
of
things
back
here
you
can
put
little
trees
on
these
foot
ones
and
just
whatever
but
it
really
helps
so
you
chose
different
planes
in
your
painting
hope
you
can
see
that
now
if
it
if
it
doesn't
show
up
quite
low
enough
you
can
take
and
add
a
little
little
highlight
to
it
I
chose
to
get
it
to
stand
out
a
little
more
maybe
that'll
help
can
see
that
a
little
better
now
there
we
go
good
okay
and
that
click
we
got
a
happy
little
footman
back
here
all
right
now
we
can
begin
putting
in
some
of
the
good
stuff
how
do
you
start
with
just
plain
old
titanium
white
and
we'll
go
right
up
here
and
just
begin
putting
in
some
happy
little
highlights
we
back
hearing
a
distance
fairly
barely
touching
barely
touching
and
sort
of
like
it
make
all
these
little
things
happen
bring
it
right
around
the
base
of
this
little
little
foot
land
back
here
now
then
let's
have
some
fun
let's
go
like
right
in
here
watch
here
grab
it
and
just
come
right
up
like
it
Oh
what
have
we
done
now
and
maybe
there's
another
one
right
here
and
back
and
let's
go
right
along
here
like
that
and
then
right
along
there
look
see
how
easy
that
is
cleaning
off
the
old
brush
here
okay
now
then
I'm
gonna
taken
another
fan
brush
it's
clean
and
very
gently
very
gently
here
I'm
just
gonna
begin
doing
like
so
see
just
work
that
back
pay
very
very
close
attention
to
angle
x'
all
you
want
to
leave
in
here
is
the
dark
area
this
is
a
time
when
the
dark
areas
are
much
more
important
than
the
light
areas
that
right
in
here
same
thing
same
thing
same
just
blend
that
up
like
it
hmm
nice
weekend
they
look
pretty
already
okay
yeah
we
can
go
right
into
a
little
bit
of
white
sea
I
begin
making
all
these
little
things
that
are
far
far
away
little
swells
that
are
far
in
the
distance
don't
want
too
much
detail
back
there
okay
good
this
is
this
painting
it'll
teach
you
to
be
an
expert
brush
washer
let's
go
back
into
our
blue
and
crimson
blue
and
crimson
just
mix
it
right
on
the
palette
all
right
now
this
area
here
we
have
to
put
dark
in
before
we
can
put
our
light
in
so
that's
just
add
a
little
bit
of
dark
color
right
here
see
how
easy
that
is
follow
that
basic
angle
so
look
at
that
they're
all
we're
doing
is
just
applying
dark
we'll
come
back
later
put
all
the
highlights
on
the
good
parts
everybody
wants
to
jump
on
these
good
parts
but
you
have
to
do
this
you
have
to
do
the
framework
first
okay
now
that
we
got
some
dark
on
there
let's
take
some
white
just
use
some
titanium
white
a
lot
of
paint
on
the
brush
now
a
lot
of
paint
I'm
okay
now
then
grab
this
and
pull
it
pull
it
strokes
are
very
important
you
might
need
to
wash
you
or
wipe
your
brush
sometimes
you
can
just
wipe
it
and
between
each
stroke
cuz
you're
gonna
pick
up
some
of
this
under
color
see
grab
it
and
pull
it
here
I
can't
okay
yeah
then
let's
let's
get
our
little
filbert
brush
here
I'm
going
to
go
into
white
and
the
least
least
little
touch
of
cadmium
yellow
white
and
yellow
white
yellow
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
then
let's
go
right
in
here
this
this
is
the
part
that
makes
the
painting
so
pretty
this
is
it
all
we're
doing
here
is
scrubbing
in
some
color
and
the
light
would
come
right
along
the
top
of
this
wave
because
of
waters
thinner
here
look
at
that
just
like
so
and
maybe
there's
a
touch
even
right
over
in
here
just
a
little
bit
right
in
there
alright
and
with
a
clean
dry
be
sure
it's
dry
its
most
important
clean
dry
two-inch
brush
come
right
in
here
very
very
gently
just
begin
blending
this
yeah
we're
gonna
begin
picking
up
some
of
this
nice
rich
lavender
color
we
have
down
here
and
blending
it
right
up
into
it
look
at
there
this
is
where
we
begin
forming
the
basic
angle
of
way
now
I
beat
the
brush
just
to
remove
excess
paint
is
it
doesn't
matter
if
a
little
that
color
goes
up
in
there
at
light
the
light
area
will
remain
let's
grab
it
before
okay
let
me
find
my
little
filbert
brush
here
we'll
use
some
of
this
lavender
color
that
we
have
same
old
lavender
color
put
a
touch
of
white
end
there
we
go
now
let's
begin
putting
some
foam
and
first
we
put
the
shadows
in
and
you
take
this
brush
and
just
lay
it
over
and
just
really
scrub
it
in
get
tough
with
it
get
mean
with
it
think
about
water
churning
and
bubbling
and
maybe
it
comes
way
up
here
and
crashes
and
splashes
and
all
kinds
of
fantastic
little
things
are
happening
and
this
is
only
the
shadow
only
the
shadow
will
come
back
and
put
the
highlights
on
you
in
a
second
okay
now
then
fill
this
in
this
needs
to
be
good
and
dark
also
like
that
and
with
our
clean
brush
we
want
to
continue
this
angle
just
grab
it
and
bring
it
through
like
there
okay
now
be
sure
you
fill
the
dressing
good
and
clean
and
dry
now
comes
the
fun
part
this
is
what
we
wait
on
take
white
CAD
yellow
load
a
lot
of
paint
into
the
bristles
just
really
fill
the
son-of-a-gun
up
okay
now
then
sort
of
hold
a
brush
here
and
give
it
a
little
upward
push
and
it's
that
upward
push
that's
where
the
splash
happens
and
when
you
begin
running
out
of
paint
turn
it
over
and
use
the
other
side
of
the
brush
and
usually
you
just
wipe
off
the
excess
you
don't
have
to
go
through
the
whole
cleaning
procedure
you
want
to
keep
this
color
as
pure
as
you
can
cause
it's
going
to
mix
with
what's
on
there
okay
plenty
of
paint
on
the
brush
plenty
of
paint
splashing
way
up
here
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
things
are
happening
continually
wipe
that
brush
keep
it
good
and
clean
and
we'll
have
a
little
bit
boom
oh
you
get
carried
away
with
these
you
can
really
get
carried
away
and
have
a
super
time
these
capes
are
fun
they're
okay
calling
off
the
brush
okay
now
with
a
good
clean
dry
brush
you
just
want
to
sort
of
mix
this
together
that'll
make
it
sort
of
make
a
different
value
a
medium
value
here
cuz
it'll
mix
with
the
dark
and
the
light
brings
it
all
together
just
stir
it
up
a
little
bit
okay
now
then
good
clean
dry
two-inch
brush
just
the
corner
and
just
mix
this
up
all
you
have
to
do
it's
just
very
gently
bring
all
this
together
very
gently
this
is
two
hairs
and
some
air
barely
barely
touching
and
that
easy
we
have
it
now
then
I'm
going
to
take
a
paint
thinner
yellow
and
white
and
be
sure
your
paint
is
as
thin
as
ink
so
very
thin
water
consistency
let's
go
right
up
here
this
nice
bright
area
here
there's
gonna
be
all
kinds
of
light
shining
through
just
put
all
these
happy
little
things
paint
at
home
and
you
have
unlimited
time
you
can
just
really
go
in
here
but
all
kinds
of
beautiful
beautiful
little
things
okay
come
right
along
here
and
just
Sparkle

like
so
mmm

take
some
white
a
little
touch
of
the
a
little
blue

little
blue
white
and
blue
and
let's
begin
working
on
some
happy
little
things
that
are
just
floating
right
on
down
through
here
all
kinds
of
little
this
is
where
you
begin
forming
the
wave
this
gives
it
shape
it
gives
a
character
look
at
that
and
back
in
here
just
bring
it
right
on
back
let's
have
some
fun
right
into
that
light
area
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
some
CAD
yellow

just
throw
that
right
on
there
right
into
the
yellow
ocher
just
like
we
did
this
guy
let's
drop
it
in
right
into
some
bright
red
we
got
us
a
fireball
going
here
then
I'm
going
to
reach
into
dark
sienna
a
little
bit
more
dark
sienna
here
then
right
into
Van
Dyck
Brown
over
here
I
want
to
get
quite
dark
so
it
makes
that
light
really
stand
out
okay
now
then
little
touch
a
fight
right
there
and
then
with
a
clean
brush
all
you
have
to
do
is
blend
all
this
together
gymnast
blends
together
but
the
color
is
sort
of
mix
and
then
lightly

go
across

then
we'll
take
a
fan
brush
I
want
to
put
titanium
white
or
the
least
least
little
touch
of
phthalo
blue
on
it
and
it
must
come
right
in
here
and
begin
making
all
kinds
of
happy
little
foam
things
just
laying
out
here
having
a
good
time
leave
some
of
these
dark
areas
