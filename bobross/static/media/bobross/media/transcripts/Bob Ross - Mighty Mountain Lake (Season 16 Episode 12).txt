hi
welcome
back
I'm
certainly
glad
you
could
join
me
today
you
ready
to
do
a
fantastic
little
painting
with
me
super
tell
you
what
let's
have
them
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
and
while
they're
doing
that
let
me
tell
you
what
I've
done
I've
got
mold
standard
18
by
24
inch
canvas
up
here
I've
covered
it
with
a
thin
even
coat
of
the
liquid
white
and
it's
all
ready
to
go
so
drag
out
your
paints
or
pull
up
yeezy
cheer
either
one
and
let's
have
some
fun
together
let's
start
out
today
with
some
Prussian
blue
good
strong
dark
blue
just
a
little
bit
of
it
let
me
say
that
again
a
little
bit
of
it
because
it
is
very
strong
on
the
two-inch
brush
let's
go
right
up
here
let's
just
drop
in
a
happy
little
sky
let's
just
do
it
let's
just
do
a
fun
painting
today
start
at
the
very
top
of
the
canvas
working
all
the
way
across
making
little
X's
little
crisscross
strokes
little
crisscross
strokes
there
we
go
and
by
working
across
like
that
and
then
begin
working
downward
your
paint
is
mixing
with
the
liquid
white
it's
already
on
the
canvas
and
automatically
your
color
will
get
lighter
and
lighter
toward
the
horizon
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
looking
for
today
let
the
paint
work
the
canvas
work
should
take
life
easy
just
let
it
go
there
we
are
very
lightly
go
across
the
whole
sky
just
take
out
the
brush
strokes
and
bring
everything
together
and
that
quick
we
got
a
quick
little
sky
very
simple
and
easy
now
that
add
a
little
more
that
color
into
the
brush
we'll
have
a
little
water
down
here
shoot
I
love
water
so
maybe
the
water
lives
in
our
world
oh
I'm
not
sure
where
it's
going
to
be
so
let's
just
throw
some
blue
in
wherever
we
want
water
we
all
have
it
there
if
we
don't
want
water
we'll
paint
right
over
it
we're
not
committed
at
this
point
we
can
do
anything
that
we
want
to
do
here
and
you'll
think
okay
and
very
lightly
we'll
go
across
the
entire
canvas
three
hairs
and
some
air
there
yeah
then
let's
wash
your
old
brush
we'll
just
scrub
him
off
and
some
odorless
thinner
give
him
a
shake
and
just
beat
the
devil
out
every
sometimes
those
brushes
get
away
and
they
go
soon
clean
there
beside
the
room
that's
when
you
find
out
who
your
friends
are
take
a
little
of
the
titanium
white
just
pull
it
in
one
direction
through
the
brush
there
get
a
lot
of
color
on
the
brush
Shoeless
mix
them
let's
make
some
big
old
fluffy
clouds
that
live
up
there
in
the
sky
tiny
little
circles
tiniest
little
circles
there
we
go
and
we're
looking
for
a
basic
shape
here
don't
just
throw
this
on
at
random
and
and
hope
that
a
cloud
will
appear
sort
of
plan
out
what
it
is
you
want
to
do
there
we
go
just
basic
cloud
shapes
and
don't
stay
in
one
area
and
keep
working
it
look
here
if
you
just
stay
here
and
keep
working
and
working
and
working
all
you
end
up
with
is
a
big
cotton
ball
now
I
got
to
get
rid
of
that
see
but
if
you
do
one
of
those
you
do
a
cloud
ectomy
and
you're
in
business
again
it's
all
it
takes
okay
keep
that
brush
moving
I
don't
dance
in
there
just
let
them
play
clouds
are
one
of
the
freest
things
in
nature
we'll
give
him
a
friend
right
here
big
old
friend
that
way
our
other
side
into
some
very
basic
little
shape
shoot
whatever
you
want
in
there
there
when
we
were
kids
we
used
to
look
at
clouds
and
see
all
kind
of
things
and
same
thing
happens
in
your
paintings
to
clouds
and
you
stand
back
a
lot
of
times
you'll
see
all
kinds
of
things
in
there
okay
now
we're
just
going
to
use
the
top
corner
of
the
two-inch
brush
gently
gently
blend
those
clouds
gently
blend
them
just
here
they
don't
overwork
them
don't
overwork
them
now
we'll
lift
them
give
them
a
little
fluff
there
we
are
and
very
lightly
two
hairs
and
some
air
just
give
them
a
little
blend
same
thing
over
here
so
give
you
some
nice
practice
with
clouds
there's
a
lot
of
fun
to
do
and
they're
very
very
easy
very
easy
I
beat
the
brush
just
to
knock
off
excess
paint
so
I
don't
have
to
clean
it
now
we
can
lift
these
up
make
some
big
ol
floaters
out
of
them
there
we
go
now
maybe
in
our
world
shoot
while
we're
doing
clouds
maybe
there's
another
little
cloud
it
lives
in
the
front
here
when
you
can
do
these
clouds
and
make
just
layer
after
layer
but
do
the
one
that's
farthest
away
first
and
work
forward
always
working
forward
there
we
go
maybe
it
comes
right
on
over
here
we
don't
know
we
don't
know
today
I'd
like
to
do
a
let's
do
a
big
mountain
I
get
a
lot
of
requests
from
people
wanting
to
do
mountains
that
don't
that
don't
have
snow
all
over
make
dark
mountains
so
maybe
we'll
try
one
of
those
today
and
if
I
the
painting
develops
out
of
it
that's
even
better
but
I'm
really
interested
in
showing
you
how
to
do
a
mountain
today
so
let's
do
that
all
right
let's
start
with
midnight
black
and
we'll
put
a
little
Van
Dyke
Brown
into
it
a
lot
of
color
pull
the
paint
out
flat
really
put
some
pressure
on
it
go
straight
down
cut
across
get
our
little
roll
of
paint
let's
go
up
here
now
you
have
to
you
have
to
make
a
big
decision
real
quick
today
or
is
your
mountain
going
to
live
maybe
in
our
world
there
it
is
comes
right
down
here
wherever
you
want
it
shoot
just
drop
it
in
really
push
that
paint
in
there
maybe
it
goes
over
here
comes
down
there
and
all
we're
looking
for
right
now
it's
just
a
basic
very
basic
shape
all
were
concerned
with
really
pushing
that
paint
in
there
this
is
just
midnight
black
did
by
Mike
Brown
in
it
okay
maybe
this
comes
over
and
look
maybe
there's
a
little
bump
there
now
when
you
do
your
painting
you
do
it
any
way
that
you
want
to
do
it
maybe
your
Mountain
has
a
totally
different
shape
and
that's
fine
painting
should
make
you
happy
it
does
nothing
else
it
shouldn't
make
you
happy
and
if
it
doesn't
make
you
happy
and
you're
doing
the
wrong
thing
because
it's
fun
and
if
you
can
do
things
all
your
life
that
make
you
happy
needless
to
say
you're
gonna
be
a
happy
person
there
we
are
now
then
I'll
just
take
this
whole
big
brush
and
very
gently
I'll
grab
some
of
this
just
pull
it
this
is
just
pulling
the
paint
down
removes
excess
paint
makes
it
even
so
you
can
add
more
colors
on
top
of
it
that's
all
there
we
go
just
let
it
blend
right
on
down
here
toward
the
base
okay
well
we
have
one
huge
mountain
today
where
we
said
was
going
to
a
big
mountain
so
what
the
heck
cut
sorry
that's
all
right
wash
the
old
brush
off
there
we
are
there
we
are
let's
have
some
fun
now
it
takes
some
Hawaii
time
you
dark
Sienna
using
the
little
knife
got
that
little
knife
a
little
band
egg
brown
over
here
but
notice
taking
one
pile
of
paint
rocks
in
on
one
side
and
white
van
Dijk
brown
white
here
now
maybe
over
in
here
what
take
some
van
Dyck
Brown
little
black
add
a
little
depression
blue
to
it
I'm
making
several
different
colors
a
little
more
blue
we'll
use
that
maybe
for
a
shadow
color
so
we
want
it
oh
that's
nice
that's
nice
that's
what
we're
looking
for
leave
all
these
colors
marble-top
now
let
me
wipe
the
old
knife
off
I
just
wipe
it
on
a
paper
towel
now
then
let's
go
up
here
get
our
little
roll
of
paint
on
the
small
knife
and
let's
begin
picking
out
some
of
these
little
highlights
touch
no
pressure
no
pressure
at
all
touch
and
just
pull
a
little
bit
of
the
shadow
color
maybe
right
back
in
there
no
pressure
though
no
pressure
here
and
there
we
can
go
back
with
a
little
dark
add
some
little
little
ridges
and
all
kinds
of
beautiful
little
things
that
are
happening
sort
of
let
your
imagination
go
and
whatever
you
want
just
all
types
of
little
things
happen
in
here
though
but
absolutely
no
pressure
with
a
knife
if
you
put
pressure
it's
going
to
look
like
you're
ice
to
cake
and
just
barely
barely
touching
pulling
him
down
to
our
shadow
color
here
and
there
touch
pull
down
and
there's
always
some
dark
shadow
areas
in
there
you
can
just
drop
them
in
blend
some
colors
in
well
you
just
make
some
of
the
most
ferocious
mountains
this
is
where
the
old
mountain
goat
lives
he
hangs
out
up
here
and
has
a
good
time
okay
maybe
over
in
here
even
some
little
things
happening
all
right
yeah
then
go
right
into
some
straight
midnight
black
let's
come
right
up
here
maybe
there's
a
maybe
there's
a
peak
it
lives
right
there
ghost
maybe
a
we
up
here
comes
down
through
there
wherever
you
want
it
just
sort
of
think
about
all
the
things
that
live
in
this
Robin
should
tell
you
what
tell
you
what
maybe
maybe
there's
a
glacier
in
there
maybe
there's
some
snow
laying
up
there
I'm
taking
a
little
depression
blue
and
white
icing
it
together
very
little
blue
little
roll
of
paint
if
you
want
to
have
a
glacier
maybe
tell
you
on
maybe
he
lives
right
along
there
make
a
decision
choppy
man
just
letting
to
notice
let
him
lay
in
there
and
sleep
there
maybe
comes
out
here
I
don't
know
and
you
know
when
you
when
you
buy
your
first
tube
of
paint
you
get
an
artist
license
and
that
license
says
you
can
do
anything
that
makes
you
happy
so
use
that
license
it
yours
forever
and
ever
okay
back
to
her
black
maybe
now
we'll
just
have
all
kind
of
little
things
that
live
right
along
in
here
like
so
wherever
we
want
them
maybe
that
comes
there
we
don't
know
we
don't
know
where
ever
shoot
maybe
some
of
it
snow
was
laying
down
in
here
but
it's
just
playing
games
here
with
contrast
a
lot
of
nice
contrast
going
on
maybe
maybe
this
little
snow
there
it
is
just
think
in
these
areas
where
there
would
be
little
areas
it
that
maybe
the
snow
would
fall
in
there
and
it
didn't
melt
and
beautiful
things
happen
hmm
and
a
little
touch
of
bright
red
here
about
color
shoe
we
get
crazy
little
more
the
dark
Sienna
but
leave
it
marble
so
you
have
all
these
streaks
happening
cuz
when
you
pick
up
that
roll
of
paint
those
streaks
are
still
in
the
paint
they're
still
in
there
and
we
can
come
along
in
here
just
change
its
flavor
a
little
bit
put
a
little
highlight
here
and
there
that
little
light
play
across
there
wherever
you
want
wherever
you
want
those
shadow
here
in
a
little
shadow
there
there
we
go
okay
and
it
just
all
transit
nice
things
happening
smart
the
dark
over
here
there
and
begin
playing
some
little
shadow
things
kind
of
make
those
little
noises
can
make
those
little
noise
little
the
color
and
Herrick
plays
right
down
through
there
so
let
your
imaginations
go
you
know
it's
fantastic
I
get
so
many
letters
from
young
people
all
across
the
country
that
are
painting
and
painting
has
opened
a
whole
new
worlds
to
him
and
it's
so
wonderful
to
hear
from
from
people
my
gosh
I'm
three
or
four
or
five
years
older
parents
write
and
tell
me
that
children
have
taken
an
interest
in
it
and
they
watched
the
show
and
they
they
paint
in
some
areas
I
have
friends
that
have
started
painting
clubs
especially
in
high
school
and
in
college
and
etc
and
they
get
together
they
paint
together
and
they
have
they
had
some
Bob
Ross
painting
gloves
and
I
was
absolutely
flattered
to
hear
that
absolutely
flattered
and
they've
sent
me
some
photographs
a
little
roll
of
paint
of
some
of
the
things
that
they're
painting
it's
unreal
it's
unreal
and
young
people
have
a
better
imagination
than
I
do
or
they
can
they
can
paint
some
of
the
most
beautiful
things
here
we're
just
putting
in
little
little
doers
wherever
you
want
to
maybe
there's
another
stone
here
in
the
front
so
maybe
up
here
just
sort
of
look
around
and
see
where
you
think
a
stone
should
live
in
your
world
these
are
some
rough
mountains
and
if
you
take
your
time
you
can
do
some
unbelievable
effects
like
this
just
take
your
time
and
work
at
it
play
enjoy
that's
the
name
of
the
game
it's
enjoying
really
already
enjoy
what
you
do
in
life
if
you
do
then
you'll
do
a
good
job
and
I
certainly
enjoy
what
I'm
doing
I
spent
half
my
life
doing
somebody
else's
thing
and
if
you
can
if
you
can
ever
ever
get
a
job
doing
the
thing
that
you
like
to
do
best
and
it's
wonderful
I'm
just
taking
a
clean
dry
two
inch
brush
I'm
just
happy
just
tapping
I
want
to
create
a
little
mist
down
here
at
the
base
of
this
little
mountain
big
mountain
hair
just
a
little
mist
then
lift
gently
upward
that
takes
out
the
tap
marks
brings
it
all
together
over
here
we'll
follow
these
ankles
sometimes
it's
nice
just
take
the
brush
the
same
way
in
and
tap
in
little
grassy
things
that
just
go
right
up
in
there
and
that's
that
works
very
well
very
well
you
just
shoot
a
we
can
even
do
a
little
touch
of
it
here
you
take
a
little
green
or
yellow
ocher
some
it
doesn't
matter
tap
a
little
color
in
there
I
just
want
to
show
you
how
I
don't
really
they're
not
really
going
to
do
much
of
it
but
you
can
see
you
just
follow
the
angles
go
right
on
up
and
you
can
you
can
have
grass
growing
all
down
here
at
the
foot
see
your
Mountain
and
that's
very
pretty
and
very
effective
new
king
that's
enough
of
that
wash
the
old
brush
just
to
show
you
how
to
do
that
area
maybe
back
here
let's
have
some
fun
shoot
we
take
some
black
Prussian
blue
van
Dyck
Brown
there's
some
crimson
maybe
a
little
SAP
green
whatever
you
got
just
mix
it
up
long
as
it's
dark
okay
we
wipe
my
knife
off
here
we
just
wipe
this
knife
on
old
paper
towel
okay
find
find
a
fan
brush
maybe
back
here
in
the
back
there's
some
maybe
there's
some
little
trees
live
back
here
let's
drop
some
of
those
in
and
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
make
the
indication
of
a
lot
of
little
trees
far
away
just
take
the
brush
and
tap
downward
and
see
as
always
to
it
you
can
make
a
whole
forest
in
a
second
here
there
we
go
and
we're
just
looking
for
basic
very
basic
shapes
these
are
too
far
away
to
have
much
detail
now
sometimes
here's
a
problem
it
happens
you
know
make
them
like
this
and
then
begins
looking
like
a
fence
if
that
should
happen
all
you
do
is
just
add
a
few
more
trees
just
fill
that
in
they
get
too
far
apart
it
look
like
a
fence
and
you
can
either
add
a
few
a
few
more
trees
or
put
wire
on
it
either
way
whatever
if
you
want
a
fence
didn't
that's
what
you're
to
have
sometimes
maybe
you
want
winter
hope
you
got
to
see
the
show
that
last
show
that
we
did
it
or
so
it
had
Hank
snow
in
it
that's
none
of
against
a
heck
of
a
painter
I
really
enjoyed
my
time
with
him
we
went
to
Nashville
net
and
I
didn't
painted
with
Hanken
cup
other
people
from
the
Grand
Ole
Opry
a
couple
of
days
he's
a
lovely
lovely
man
hope
he
sings
on
the
Grand
Ole
Opry
for
another
50
years
okay
I
have
it
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
down
here
maybe
some
little
little
trunks
on
those
trees
I'll
just
take
a
little
white
on
the
fan
brush
grab
it
lift
upward
make
it
look
like
little
trunks
that
are
far
far
away
if
you
happen
to
put
one
in
there
that's
too
light
just
rub
it
a
little
bit
it'll
go
away
okay
yeah
maybe
back
here
just
use
that
same
old
color
I'm
just
going
to
tap
in
what'll
end
up
being
a
little
land
area
back
here
a
little
a
little
Lin
remember
we
wouldn't
worried
about
where
our
lake
was
going
to
be
or
a
little
pond
because
we
decided
we
just
chop
off
whatever
we
didn't
want
now
is
the
time
to
do
that
decide
where
your
pond
is
going
to
be
grab
pull
straight
down
just
pull
it
straight
down
and
this
will
this
will
be
the
reflection
instant
reflection
is
that
easy
then
go
gently
lightly
across
there
you
are
huh
okay
now
then
let's
put
some
let's
put
some
pretty
things
out
there
maybe
this
is
fall
and
all
the
beautiful
colors
are
beginning
to
have
a
shoot
let's
get
over
here
and
some
red
Indian
yellow
make
this
one
a
lot
of
red
in
it
but
when
you
do
it
you
make
it
with
any
color
that
you
want
I'm
just
in
a
mood
today
to
do
some
beautiful
colors
some
nice
bright
colors
it's
a
fantastic
day
it's
a
good
day
to
be
alive
I'm
kind
of
think
of
it
every
day
is
a
good
day
to
be
alive
there
we
are
just
tap
you
came
many
people
come
over
on
this
side
just
drop
in
a
few
more
little
things
that
think
about
the
lay
of
the
land
begins
getting
very
important
ooh
beautiful
red
color
there
in
Alaska
we
have
a
lot
of
mountains
like
this
and
in
the
fall
the
colors
will
change
you
have
all
the
oranges
and
yellows
and
red
looks
like
looks
like
a
painter
went
crazy
and
his
palette
spilled
all
over
the
all
over
the
landscape
and
I've
never
seen
such
things
as
Alaska
has
in
the
autumn
that
colors
are
absolutely
spectacular
a
little
bit
here
and
there
okay
now
let's
take
a
little
bit
of
em
that
ground
let's
just
scrub
a
little
dirt
down
here
at
the
bottom
just
really
scrub
an
idea
there
we
go
a
little
bit
of
the
liquid
white
on
the
knife
and
with
that
let's
just
put
a
little
water
line
in
just
to
break
it
up
there
we
go
all
right
tell
you
what
let's
do
maybe
back
here
maybe
there's
some
bigger
evergreens
we
just
take
the
fan
brush
go
right
into
that
color
a
lot
of
paint
in
the
bristles
let's
go
right
up
here
maybe
their
lives
in
our
world
maybe
there's
an
evergreen
that
was
there
just
sort
of
look
around
and
you're
painting
because
each
painting
is
different
each
painting
is
different
just
put
them
in
and
go
with
them
wherever
you
want
wherever
let's
put
one
on
the
other
side
what
the
heck
right
there
there
he
is
yes

maybe
down
in
here
there's
some
tell
you
what
let's
do
let's
put
some
yep
right
along
here
let's
just
close
this
little
pond
yep
if
we
had
another
10
minutes
on
the
show
there
wouldn't
be
a
pond
at
all
we
just
keep
taking
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
away
from
it
there
now
you
have
just
a
skinny
little
pond
out
there
just
enough
to
be
very
pretty
okay
we
can
come
back
with
our
nice
highlight
colors
or
fall
colors
the
ochres
and
yellows
and
bright
red
let's
just
begin
putting
in
all
kinds
of
little
little
grassy
things
here
oh
there's
more
that
red
I
like
that
it's
pretty
there
we
go
just
decide
where
you
want
to
drop
them
in
that's
all
maybe
tell
you
what
miss
let's
have
a
little
bit
of
fun
maybe
down
here

use
some
CAD
yellow

nice
red
one
Jack
Frost
has
hit
him
hard
really
something
there
we
go

of
letters
asking
