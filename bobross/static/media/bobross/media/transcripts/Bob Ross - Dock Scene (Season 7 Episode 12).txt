hey
I'm
glad
you
could
join
me
again
today
today
let's
do
one
that's
a
little
more
complicated
than
a
lot
of
them
that
we've
done
I
think
you'll
enjoy
it
let's
have
them
graphically
run
all
the
colors
across
your
screen
that
you
need
to
do
this
painting
and
they'll
come
across
in
the
same
order
I
have
them
on
my
palette
I've
already
covered
the
canvas
with
liquid
white
it's
wet
and
slick
ready
to
go
and
I
hope
you
are
too
so
let's
go
up
here
and
do
it
I'm
going
to
take
off
today
with
a
little
bit
of
the
blue
little
bit
of
phthalo
blue
and
into
that
I'm
going
to
add
a
little
bit
of
Van
Dyke
Brown
right
into
the
blue
just
work
it
on
the
brush
here
just
go
ahead
up
here
now
let's
do
a
little
happy
sky
here
so
maybe
a
little
more
Brown
I
want
to
dull
that
Scavo
there
we
go
there
we
good
good
today
I
thought
we
do
a
let's
do
a
painting
or
some
Docs
it'll
a
lot
of
requests
from
people
in
Maine
and
Florida
what
would
want
some
some
boats
and
the
dock
scene
so
see
what
we
can
do
here
I
mean
I
just
have
some
fun
and
very
quickly
there
we
just
throw
in
a
happy
little
sky
well
I
got
this
old
brush
go
in
same
color
Van
Dyck
Brown
a
little
bit
of
the
day
little
blue
let's
go
right
down
here
once
again
although
there
we
go
I
just
pull
that
across
Kimmy
Betty
start
at
the
bottom
and
work
up
and
that
way
automatically
it
mixes
with
the
liquid
white
and
gets
lighter
toward
the
horizon
and
that's
what
we're
looking
for
okay
now
I'm
going
to
take
a
nice
clean
dry
brush
and
just
blend
the
sky
out
a
little
bit
I
always
spend
a
bunch
of
time
in
the
sky
today
lerner
think
I'll
put
some
buildings
in
this
one
I'll
show
you
show
you
a
super
way
of
making
old
wood
some
beautiful
old
buildings
okay
nice
take
your
same
old
brush
and
go
right
into
some
titanium
white
pull
it
in
one
direction
loaded
full
of
paints
go
back
up
here
now
then
just
the
indication
of
a
happy
little
cloud
or
two
there
this
just
floats
around
in
the
sky
here
and
has
fine
just
here
just
for
the
flame
back
a
little
bit
more
color
there
we
go
oh
my
cat
that'll
give
us
and
occasionally
a
few
little
clouds
I
use
another
clean
brush
I
have
several
brushes
going
here
so
I
don't
have
to
stop
and
wash
them
all
the
time
cameraman
gets
upset
with
me
when
I
watch
too
many
brushes
there
we
go
then
we'll
lift
that
and
we
have
some
great
big
billowy
fluffy
clouds
just
floating
around
this
guy
here
that
easy
okay
now
I'm
going
into
some
blue
and
a
little
touch
of
the
midnight
black
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
that
may
be
back
here
this
is
a
maybe
like
a
little
harbor
you
can
see
a
few
little
distant
trees
just
use
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
just
put
a
few
little
indications
here
and
there
far
far
away
far
away
touch
pull
down
with
a
little
touch
of
reflection
underneath
it
just
by
pulling
it
straight
down
and
very
lightly
going
across
it's
time
to
clean
a
brush
cameraman's
on
his
own
now
right
in
between
here
I
want
to
tap
this
and
create
a
little
misty
area
and
lift
it
up
just
let
it
all
sort
of
blend
together
very
softly
I
don't
want
to
be
with
tell
her
one
stops
the
other
one
starts
very
soft
far
far
away
and
maybe
a
little
closer
here
maybe
there's
a
little
bigger
a
little
bigger
tree
we'll
take
some
Browns
and
black
just
case
go
ahead
up
here
he
lives
I'm
just
tapping
this
one
out
look
at
there
just
drop
it
in
like
so
and
I'll
go
right
into
a
little
bit
of
the
yellow
just
load
a
little
color
on
there
let's
go
back
up
here
just
want
to
put
some
little
indication
of
a
few
highlights
in
this
one
see
I'm
really
not
interested
in
a
lot
of
bushes
in
this
one
so
I'll
just
do
this
real
quick
there
okay
now
that
I
think
gives
us
a
happy
little
tree
wash
the
brush
again
hmm
there
we
are
okay
now
then
I
want
to
put
a
bunch
of
buildings
in
here
show
you
an
easy
way
of
doing
that
mm-hmm
let's
go
right
into
some
brown
here
using
the
big
brush
this
is
Van
Dyck
Brown
just
go
into
it
load
a
lot
of
paint
into
the
bristles
pull
it
pull
it
wiglet
that
brings
it
to
a
nice
sharp
chisel
edge
and
don't
be
afraid
to
load
some
paint
into
the
brush
we're
gonna
use
a
lot
of
Brown
today
look
at
that
brush
see
how
sharp
it
is
good
let's
go
up
here
now
then
we
got
to
make
some
big
decisions
I
think
we
have
a
building
that
lives
right
there
there's
the
one
of
the
eaves
and
we
got
to
figure
out
where
his
roof
is
maybe
it
comes
down
I
can't
here's
the
other
side
see
how
easy
you
could
just
sort
of
lay
these
out
there's
one
and
you're
still
at
this
point
you're
really
not
committed
you're
just
having
fun
maybe
there's
another
one
comes
there
it
is
same
thing
just
bring
all
these
together
it
goes
this
way
and
we
need
a
front
on
this
building
just
bring
it
right
on
down
and
whatever
goes
in
there
will
turn
into
reflections
we'll
just
turn
it
right
into
reflections
no
big
deal
grab
it
over
here
pull
it
down
Jared
think
you
could
make
a
building
that
easy
using
a
big
old
brush
you
can
you
can
you
can
do
anything
maybe
right
in
here
we'll
pull
that
down
I
bet
at
home
you
say
boy
he
has
done
it
this
time
she
has
got
a
mess
corner
you
may
be
right
there
where
I
don't
care
some
of
that
goes
into
the
water
it'll
all
turn
into
nice
reflections
eventually
okay
here's
the
roof
and
we're
still
not
really
committed
we're
not
committed
until
we
start
putting
all
the
little
highlights
on
then
we
have
to
make
big
decisions
there
we
go
now
then
let's
put
a
few
of
those
nice
little
highlights
on
there
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
some
white
same
old
dirty
brush
pick
up
some
of
this
Sienna
okay
let's
look
at
the
brush
look
at
there
see
all
the
colors
happening
in
that
brush
okay
let's
go
back
up
here
now
then
this
is
where
we
start
making
decisions
touch
just
barely
touch
and
start
working
down
and
let
the
brush
shake
and
tremble
a
little
bit
it
really
helps
if
you're
a
little
bit
nervous
here
look
at
there
go
back
up
here
they
just
let
it
bounce
along
play
already
it's
beginning
to
look
like
old
old
wood
ol
Woods
fun
to
make
I
like
old
wood
I
really
like
it
better
than
new
shiny
wood
looks
better
in
paintings
to
me
okay
you
just
sort
of
layer
this
on
you
need
that
dark
underneath
though
so
this
light
color
shows
otherwise
you
don't
you
don't
get
it
to
show
any
much
there
yeah
then
we'll
take
the
knife
and
let's
put
a
few
little
indications
of
some
boards
there
I
go
right
into
the
brown
cut
off
a
little
hunk
just
a
little
tiny
bit
right
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
all
right
now
that
a
few
little
boards
little
slabs
wherever
you
think
they
were
to
be
all
I'm
doing
is
just
touching
the
canvas
just
touch
it
touch
it
touch
it
soon
put
as
many
in
or
as
few
as
you
want
but
you
need
that
little
roll
of
paint
right
out
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
there
put
one
in
there
this
old
carpenter
is
like
me
he
just
picked
up
whatever
was
available
didn't
matter
to
him
we
had
to
figure
out
where
this
sides
gonna
be
here
maybe
it's
going
to
be
right
there
we'll
start
cutting
that
off
you
could
paint
this
whole
building
with
a
knife
I
just
sort
of
like
this
effect
this
is
something
I've
been
working
on
for
a
while
I
thought
you
would
enjoy
it
too
yes
I
don't
like
this
effect
so
now
we
have
a
dark
edge
there
yeah
let's
put
let's
put
some
roof
on
it
we
use
some
black
I've
got
a
blue
a
little
bit
of
white
cut
off
a
little
roll
of
paint
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
just
gonna
let
that
sort
of
just
bounce
along
and
play
oopah
blue
just
let
it
just
bounce
wherever
we're
still
not
too
committed
at
this
point
same
color
a
little
bit
lighter
look
at
that
old
weathered
well
when
you're
out
here
on
the
water
you
catch
the
devil
this
is
where
all
the
pelicans
in
the
seagulls
Park
there
a
little
bit
of
highlight
right
along
the
roof
maybe
touch
lighter
on
this
side
so
shows
up
there
we
go
thank
you
can
see
that
a
little
better
there
kay
yeah
we
said
there
was
gonna
be
another
building
here
so
put
that
there
pulling
down
and
I
can
begin
adding
some
highlights
to
that
the
dark
Sienna
a
little
white
just
tap
it
okay
let's
go
up
here
if
your
roofs
gonna
be
right
here
touch
it
stay
that
wiggle
as
I
say
this
is
really
where
pays
to
be
a
little
bit
nervous
oh
look
at
that
I'm
just
barely
barely
grazing
the
canvas
just
barely
barely
grazing
lighter
the
better
okay
now
into
that
I'll
add
a
few
boards
these
little
boards
just
helped
define
give
it
a
little
more
interest
a
little
more
detail
look
at
there
at
all
the
little
things
and
you
put
as
many
as
you
want
in
yours
maybe
appear
at
the
top
it'd
be
a
little
more
shadow
seeing
put
a
little
dark
just
let
it
bounce
along
same
over
here
a
little
bit
of
dark
little
dark
okay
now
now
now
comes
the
fun
with
a
very
dry
brush
grazing
it
just
touch
it
give
it
to
Lee's
little
boat
barely
barely
touch
it
barely
barely
touch
you've
been
that
sneaky
look
at
that
and
you
can
pull
it
across
like
so
to
really
make
it
look
weathered
and
then
go
down
creates
all
kinds
of
nice
effects
just
here
and
there
pull
across
and
then
go
down
very
lightly
thought
you'd
like
that
that
really
is
a
nice
way
of
making
old
boards
if
you're
making
old
barns
or
whatever
okay
we
need
a
we
need
a
happy
door
in
here
so
just
use
a
knife
there
drop
a
tea
in
real
quick
there
we
go
just
a
little
door
take
a
little
bit
of
the
light
color
go
around
this
makes
the
door
stand
out
a
little
better
can
maybe
tell
you
maybe
there's
a
little
window
right
here
just
come
across
a
little
bit
of
brown
white
just
to
highlight
him
there
you
go
now
this
is
old
building
here
I
wanted
to
find
this
edge
a
little
bit
more
so
it
stands
out
this
is
where
we
need
a
little
knife
we
can
sneak
in
here
this
little
knife
see
there
bring
it
edge
up
here
right
here
so
another
big
door
drop
it
in
there
go
little
brown
and
white
a
little
touch
of
highlight
right
around
the
door
and
that
makes
it
stand
out
okay
maybe
there's
some
maybe
maybe
there's
a
walkway
around
here
and
it
lives
right
here
so
I'm
gonna
just
pull
this
out
once
again
you
don't
care
what's
happening
in
here
you're
gonna
need
some
dark
in
here
for
for
shadows
you
can
just
lay
annual
thing
in
there
st.
go
right
up
between
those
buildings
cut
this
off
right
there
wherever
you
want
it
ever
see
a
walkway
here
here's
a
little
bit
of
that
gray
color
it's
very
lightly
just
enough
to
give
it
a
little
highlight
come
around
little
pea
deuce
hearing
they're
kidding
yeah
with
a
clean
brush
I'll
grab
a
stark
color
we
can
begin
creating
the
illusion
of
reflections
just
like
now
tell
you
what
just
use
a
little
bit
of
black
here
maybe
there's
a
few
if
you
will
post
here
you
have
something
to
hold
that
up
there
they
go
take
a
little
brown
and
white
but
touch
a
highlight
on
them
just
just
touching
it
thanks
so
now
with
a
brush
I'm
gonna
grab
the
bottom
of
those
just
pull
them
down
go
across
and
that
quick
we
have
we
have
some
reflections
like
a
little
liquid
white
just
sort
of
work
a
little
that
here
and
there
just
so
it
creates
a
little
sheen
of
light
playing
across
the
water
no
that
makes
it
look
like
water
not
easy
that
easy
ok
let's
have
some
fun
maybe
there's
another
big
building
in
here
loo
that
2
inch
brush
back
up
and
here
it
is
there
it
is
we'll
just
put
it
just
make
a
decision
throw
it
in
shoot
this
is
your
world
do
anything
you
want
to
do
in
here
now
maybe
comes
right
down
right
down
right
down
right
down
just
like
so
let's
fill
that
all
in
here
all
I'm
doing
just
just
basically
covering
up
the
canvas
with
paint
you
can
bring
it
to
any
point
that
you
want
it
don't
want
too
much
overhang
here
so
I'll
just
make
the
building
a
little
bit
wider
there
we
go
wherever
you
wanting
to
be
cain't
let's
have
some
fun
on
this
old
building
to
tell
you
what
what
we're
doing
that
maybe
maybe
the
walkway
comes
right
out
through
here
too
we
don't
know
we
don't
care
there's
no
any
way
seeing
that
helps
push
everything
back
helps
create
the
illusion
of
distance
now
then
let's
let's
play
a
little
bit
here
right
into
the
dark
sienna
the
white
back
and
forth
okay
let's
go
up
here
let's
do
it
touch
just
let
this
brush
see
it's
just
barely
hitting
can
you
see
what's
happening
want
this
to
look
like
old
old
weathered
wood
look
at
that
look
at
that
look
like
old
wood
I
really
thought
you'd
enjoy
this
this
is
sort
of
a
neat
neat
waiter
to
do
this
just
opens
up
a
whole
new
world
of
old
buildings
now
see
this
one
in
my
mind
over
here
was
farther
away
so
I
smoothed
this
a
little
more
this
one
I'm
gonna
leave
rough
and
I'm
gonna
leave
it
ragged
because
it's
closer
to
you'd
see
more
detail
can
we
use
a
little
knife
here
in
a
little
blue
I'm
gonna
touch
it
white
a
little
bit
of
brown
pull
it
out
and
cut
across
tiniest
little
roll
of
paint
out
here
okay
now
that
I
just
wanna
just
go
right
in
here
and
just
sort
of
move
it
back
and
forth
so
you
get
little
chica
ticket
chicks
in
there
then
take
the
knife
and
smooth
that
pull
it
in
that
angle
if
you
want
to
create
some
shadows
in
this
old
building
take
a
little
bit
of
black
on
your
brush
and
once
again
just
let
it
bounce
and
tap
play
look
at
that
look
at
there
that's
fascinating
to
me
okay
listen
let's
put
a
few
little
Amy
this
is
got
some
doors
in
here
like
kiss
see
there
a
little
bit
of
black
on
the
knife
or
a
brown
either
one
whatever
is
dark
I
can't
maybe
here
and
there
you
can
make
out
the
indication
of
board
whatever
okay
maybe
there's
gonna
be
we'll
do
it
right
there
there's
a
window
right
there
I
don't
know
what
all
these
old
buildings
already
just
look
the
nice
so
we
drop
them
in
but
a
little
bit
right
there
I
will
put
a
little
Dewar
like
yet
see
and
then
sneaky
now
then
tell
you
what
let's
do
I
put
a
happy
little
boat
right
here
I'm
gonna
be
right
into
the
Venn
diagram
I'm
using
number
three
fan
brush
kidding
let's
go
right
up
here
now
you
got
to
make
a
decision
where
does
he
live
well
let's
put
him
right
there
there's
this
front
and
he
comes
right
around
and
goes
around
put
and
there's
his
back
right
now
all
we're
doing
is
just
laying
in
some
paint
she
has
to
get
a
basic
shape
like
so
bring
it
around
to
then
the
other
side
sort
of
see
these
things
in
your
mind
and
he
starts
off
really
looking
terrible
there
we
go
just
begin
forming
him
thanks
oh
yeah
then
we
can
begin
playing
a
little
bit
add
a
little
white
to
that
brush
and
this
is
the
front
just
mm-hm
Teddy
in
a
little
bit
more
the
white
we
got
to
define
heart
edges
are
gonna
be
there
it
comes
comes
right
on
around
a
little
bit
showing
on
the
back
yeah
very
lightly
I
can't
laying
it
in
see
it's
both
sort
of
looking
a
little
bit
toward
you
it's
not
and
then
with
a
little
bit
of
dark
color
on
the
brush
I
want
to
just
grab
the
bottom
and
pull
down
cuz
there
would
be
a
nice
reflection
underneath
here
and
this
is
also
the
way
you
sort
of
straighten
him
up
a
little
bit
take
out
any
you
need
to
form
a
tease
you
have
in
your
boat
sometimes
I
do
some
boots
it
has
some
deformities
a
little
bit
on
the
other
side
and
leave
that
very
dark
little
tiny
tiny
middle
light
right
there
just
enough
to
give
us
an
indication
pull
that
down
like
so
very
lightly
very
lightly
go
across
okay
now
then
need
a
place
for
the
fellow
to
set
in
there
when
he's
out
fishing
in
this
boat
so
we'll
cut
across
a
little
bit
of
brown
let's
go
here
they
were
give
him
a
little
little
house
here
come
on
this
way
down
that
way
see
that's
all
there
is
to
it
even
a
little
place
he
needs
a
little
place
to
sit
I
have
it
on
this
side
over
here
a
little
bit
of
color
on
the
other
side
let's
go
this
way
just
a
little
bit
more
and
then
let's
put
him
adorn
in
there
he's
gonna
have
way
to
get
in
and
out
I'll
use
a
little
black
hair
on
the
small
knife
give
a
little
door
right
there
remember
this
is
sort
of
an
angle
you
seeing
a
three-quarter
view
so
you
wouldn't
see
all
of
it
miss
kima
kind
of
have
a
window
up
here
so
you
can
see
i
want
him
to
be
driving
around
out
there
blind
shoot
you
probably
drive
like
i
do
then
there
we
go
pull
that
back
around
like
so
a
little
the
liquid
white
to
that
I'm
going
to
add
smallest
amount
of
blue
and
brown
just
like
there
cut
across
it
let's
put
a
few
happy
little
water
lines
rat
around
like
so
there
you
can
put
as
many
or
as
few
of
these
in
yours
as
you
want
just
drop
him
and
they
help
create
the
illusion
of
water
thank
you
a
few
of
these
little
sparkles
here
they're
rounding
up
here
take
a
least
little
touch
of
the
bright
red
least
little
touch
okay
all
right
here
just
barely
touch
a
little
bit
right
there
a
little
right
over
there
just
to
put
a
little
half
a
pyramid
kind
of
have
him
a
little
hat
maybe
maybe
maybe
yep
yep
look
at
here
look
here
maybe
there's
a
little
little
mask
up
there
hey
will
will
get
crazy
we'll
do
another
one
back
here
we
kiss
one
bigger
there
we
go
Li's
little
touch
of
light
on
that
oops
just
drop
it
in
here
and
there
just
enjoy
okay
I'll
put
a
little
thing
across
there
yeah
let's
take
a
little
liquid
right
cut
to
not
cross
in
the
night
and
that's
maybe
there's
a
few
little
wires
hmm
go
right
down
here
you
little
little
pieces
of
rigging
soon
some
couple
over
here
however
many
you
want
it's
up
to
you
there
you
go
I'll
give
you
an
idea
of
a
nice
simple
easy
way
to
make
a
happy
little
boat
okay
back
into
my
dark
color
here
let's
finish
up
this
walkway
put
some
color
in
there
this
is
just
just
applying
some
base
color
right
here
really
not
worried
about
detail
I'll
tell
you
why
tell
you
what
I
want
a
nice
post
right
there
nice
big
strong
post
but
another
one
there
so
you
put
as
many
old
post
as
you
want
in
yours
here's
one
there
there's
another
one
look
at
all
them
son
of
a
gun
so
you've
had
a
hard
life
out
here
maybe
there's
one
goes
right
on
off
the
canvas
right
there
okay
yeah
a
little
bit
of
highlight
touch
give
it
a
little
pull
just
barely
touch
give
it
a
pull
there
we
go
there
we
go
right
here's
one
okay
hey
hey
maybe
yep
maybe
there's
an
old
post
that
comes
across
here
now
you
can
just
get
carried
away
here
and
keep
going
and
going
and
going
just
want
to
show
you
some
ideas
on
on
how
to
do
some
of
these
fantastic
things
for
joy
and
joy
I'll
go
into
my
dark
Sienna
a
little
bit
of
the
white
just
touch
had
a
little
black
to
that
I
want
it
darker
all
right
there
let's
go
up
here
I'll
make
this
look
like
a
would
follow
the
angles
just
touch
it
let
it
bounce
Cheeka
Cheeka
Cheeka
Cheeka
jazz
let
it
bounce
barely
barely
grazing
the
canvas
here
we
go
touch
touch
now
this'll
would
here
a
lot
of
people
walked
on
it
he
wouldn't
be
as
rough
as
this
building
it'd
be
a
little
bit
smoother
so
to
make
it
a
little
smoother
take
the
brush
very
lightly
pull
it
just
barely
touch
look
at
that
yeah
let's
put
the
indication
of
a
few
boards
here
just
hearing
their
I
don't
get
bigger
as
they
come
towards
you
wider
more
distance
between
them
there
we
go
very
lightly
grab
it
give
it
a
little
pull
you
can
also
take
a
little
less
black
and
create
the
illusion
of
a
few
shadows
just
pull
it
look
at
that
take
my
knife
a
little
bit
of
the
red
just
for
color
sake
and
we'll
put
a
little
red
right
on
top
of
these
posts
and
I
think
we've
got
a
finished
painting
and
with
that
I'd
like
to
wish
you
happy
painting
god
bless
see
you
next
time
you
