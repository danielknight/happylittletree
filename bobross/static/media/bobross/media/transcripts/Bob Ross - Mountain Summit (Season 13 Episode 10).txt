welcome
back
certainly
glad
you
decided
to
spend
a
half
hour
with
us
today
I
think
you'll
enjoy
the
little
painting
we're
going
to
do
and
I
hope
you
take
the
time
to
paint
along
or
you
pull
up
your
easy
chair
and
just
relax
with
us
thought
today
we
just
do
a
fun
painting
one
did
it's
a
lot
of
them
always
you'd
have
a
good
time
with
it
let's
just
do
it
let's
start
out
in
home
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
along
with
me
and
they'll
come
across
as
usual
in
the
same
orders
I
have
them
on
the
palette
while
you're
doing
that
shoot
let's
go
on
up
here
and
get
started
we
have
our
canvas
up
the
liquid
whites
on
it
it's
ready
some
we'll
start
off
today
with
a
little
bit
of
they
little
blue
we
use
the
old
two
inch
brush
grab
a
touch
of
the
midnight
black
also
halo
blue
and
midnight
black
just
sort
of
mix
them
together
on
the
brush
let's
go
up
here
and
just
using
our
little
crisscross
strokes
let's
just
drop
in
a
happy
little
sky
just
start
at
the
top
and
work
all
the
way
across
just
making
little
X's
and
then
begin
working
downward
and
your
color
is
mixing
with
the
liquid
white
continually
and
automatically
automatically
your
sky
will
get
lighter
and
lighter
toward
the
horizon
and
that's
one
of
those
little
tricks
that
helped
create
the
illusion
of
depth
in
your
painting
as
things
get
further
away
from
you
in
a
landscape
they
should
get
lighter
in
value
so
let
the
liquid
white
work
and
it'll
have
them
automatically
here
and
just
sort
of
blend
it
all
together
there
we
are
and
very
lightly
this
flow
across
it
takes
out
the
brushstrokes
and
that
easy
you
can
get
a
fantastic
little
sky
yeah
well
we
have
that
color
on
the
brush
I'll
add
just
a
little
more
blue
and
black
and
let's
have
a
little
touch
of
water
in
this
painting
today
so
now
once
again
we
want
it
to
be
lighter
toward
the
horizon
so
start
at
the
bottom
and
work
up
word
your
darker
color
then
will
be
down
here
on
the
base
see
there
and
then
just
work
upward
and
automatically
once
again
you'll
get
a
lighter
value
as
it
works
upward
toward
the
horizon
okay
and
then
we'll
need
some
order
on
the
other
side
don't
want
it
left
out
I
don't
know
exactly
where
lambs
gonna
be
the
waters
gonna
be
so
we
just
covered
all
with
water
if
we
want
to
treat
a
live
here
here
we'll
just
we'll
just
drop
again
there
now
then
very
lightly
just
gently
go
across
and
bring
it
all
together
okay
now
then
we
can
wash
your
brush
and
we
wash
our
brushes
we'd
cuddle
over
this
dinner
I
never
used
I'd
never
used
turpentine
when
I'm
washing
brushes
it
leaves
up
it
leaves
a
residue
on
your
brushes
which
is
very
difficult
to
get
out
plus
it
smells
bad
Oh
smells
turbot
one
drop
of
turpentine
your
house
and
you'll
be
working
by
yourself
I'll
tell
you
because
he'll
run
everybody
in
the
house
out
okay
titanium
white
wood
just
use
your
two
inch
brush
what
the
heck
let's
build
just
a
happy
little
cloud
and
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
make
little
clouds
it
just
take
the
corn
of
the
brush
and
just
half
the
canvas
with
it
just
tap
the
canvas
we
just
want
a
little
floater
it
lives
up
here
in
the
sky
just
has
a
good
time
just
tap
and
you've
making
this
thick
or
as
thin
as
you
wanting
whatever
we'll
give
them
a
little
friend
there
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
tap
now
if
you
want
your
clouds
to
look
more
distinct
and
brighter
make
your
sky
a
little
darker
and
when
you're
using
only
white
paint
then
that
sounded
we
gotta
jump
out
at
you
if
you
have
a
if
have
a
scat
is
not
very
dark
and
you
put
white
paint
against
it
then
you
don't
have
much
contrast
so
it
won't
look
too
bright
there
I'm
just
gonna
stir
these
up
a
little
just
mix
them
a
little
bit
give
them
a
little
this
is
this
is
to
me
is
the
way
I
fluffed
the
cloud
up
just
sort
of
fluff
it
up
let
a
little
wind
run
through
it
there
and
then
very
lightly
just
barely
grazing
the
canvas
caress
the
canvas
just
blend
it
together
and
that's
one
of
the
nicest
easiest
little
ways
to
make
a
cloud
okay
now
then
tell
you
what
let's
build
us
a
little
mountain
today
you
know
it's
funny
I
get
a
lot
of
letters
from
people
and
sometimes
they
say
Bob
I'm
tired
of
mountains
do
something
different
and
then
I
get
probably
as
many
letters
and
say
do
more
mountains
so
if
you
don't
want
to
mountain
in
your
painting
just
leave
a
little
rascal
out
but
if
you
want
a
mountain
then
you
have
it
okay
Ken
we'll
take
some
black
some
Prussian
blue
alizarin
crimson
and
mix
it
together
pull
it
out
very
flat
cut
across
we
have
our
little
roll
of
paint
out
here
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
there
it
is
now
just
decide
where
your
mountain
lives
in
your
world
and
push
very
firmly
and
just
drop
a
little
rascal
in
the
only
thing
you're
worried
about
is
it
nice
outside
edge
you
know
you
don't
care
what's
happening
on
the
inside
right
now
we
will
later
but
right
now
we're
just
looking
for
a
nice
outside
edge
as
I
say
use
a
lot
of
pressure
here
push
that
paint
right
into
the
fabric
Wow
scrape
off
all
the
excess
paint
just
get
in
there
and
really
scrape
it
off
you're
not
gonna
hurt
the
canvas
there
we
go
with
a
large
brush
let
us
pull
that
and
then
it'll
mix
with
a
liquid
white
is
on
the
canvas
and
automatically
you'll
get
a
lighter
and
lighter
down
toward
the
base
just
softer
and
softer
there
we
go
and
that
son
of
a
gun
should
look
like
it's
just
sort
of
floating
right
up
here
in
the
sky
and
it
gives
you
a
nice
base
now
to
begin
putting
highlights
on
let
me
clean
the
old
brush
again
I
like
to
wash
these
brushes
shake
it
off
there
we
go
now
then
today
I'm
just
going
to
use
let
us
just
take
titanium
white
pull
it
out
very
flat
it's
just
playing
away
now
this
is
one
of
those
times
you
really
need
a
firm
paint
this
paint
should
be
very
firm
you
know
people
say
how
firm
is
it
look
at
that
the
night
literally
sticks
right
on
the
palate
it's
very
firm
cut
off
a
little
roll
of
paint
like
so
now
then
no
pressure
no
pressure
there
see
there
just
touch
and
just
let
it
flow
right
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
but
no
pressure
you
want
it
to
break
like
this
and
have
all
those
little
holes
and
bumps
in
it
there
we
go
I
end
up
here
see
there
it's
so
easy
at
times
it's
hard
there
we
go
no
pressure
though
can't
say
that
enough
times
probably
the
most
common
mistake
made
is
applying
too
much
pressure
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ways
that
there
is
to
learn
to
use
a
knife
and
if
you
could
make
it
can
make
snow
break
on
these
mountains
then
you
can
just
make
a
multitude
of
other
things
it's
unbelievable
what
you
can
do
just
by
learning
to
let
the
snow
break
here
but
delicate
touch
light
touch
I
think
I've
mentioned
over
and
over
again
and
as
teaching
Steve
my
son
to
paint
the
only
way
to
get
it
across
to
him
was
to
tell
him
that
I
want
him
to
pretend
that
he
was
a
whisper
that
just
floated
across
the
mountain
and
then
he
understood
it
worked
for
him
and
he
makes
some
of
the
most
beautiful
mountains
today
you
ever
seen
use
a
little
blue
and
white
here
in
our
little
roll
of
paint
and
I
want
to
put
a
shadow
behind
this
no
pressure
just
let
it
float
see
there
just
let
that
float
right
in
there
and
each
highlight
each
little
peak
in
here
if
you
want
it
to
be
an
individual
needs
a
shadow
there
right
there
give
it
a
blue
shadow
and
you
can
you
can
change
this
mountain
continually
maybe
you
want
to
put
a
bump
over
here
another
peak
so
you
can
do
that
in
your
world
you
can
create
any
illusion
that
you
want
I
think
that's
what
attracted
me
to
painting
so
much
if
I
could
create
any
kind
of
world
that
I
want
nothing
hurts
here
is
no
pain
nobody's
unhappy
it's
a
pleasant
place
everything
is
nice
here
okay
now
then
with
a
large
brush
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
of
a
mist
so
all
I'm
going
to
do
here
it's
just
happen
the
base
there's
tech
following
the
angles
in
the
mountain
always
following
those
angles
and
then
lift
upward
see
and
all
that
little
misty
things
just
sort
of
happen
over
here
follow
these
angles
sometimes
I'll
take
a
little
let
blue
in
the
brush
maybe
you
want
to
bring
this
right
on
around
I'll
take
a
little
that
shadow
color
and
we
can
just
make
it
sort
of
look
like
it
wraps
around
I
sneaky
it
adds
a
little
more
interest
to
your
mountain
that
easy
and
just
sort
of
tap
it
out
bring
it
together
okay
that's
all
there
is
to
it
let's
have
some
fun
I'm
going
to
mix
up
some
black
pression
blue
shoot
we'll
throw
some
van
Dijk
some
crimson
in
there
a
little
SAP
green
whatever
you
get
just
mainly
dark
colors
there
let
me
clean
the
knife
off
and
let's
use
let's
use
our
old
fan
brush
today
let's
go
in
here
and
load
some
color
right
onto
the
brush
just
load
both
sides
of
the
brush
up
now
then
let's
have
some
fun
let's
just
push
in
maybe
there's
some
little
background
things
that
live
we
back
in
the
distance
back
here
far
away
I'm
just
pushing
making
the
bristles
bend
upward
town
yes
just
a
lot
a
lot
of
that
enough
to
do
just
be
happy
enjoy
have
fun
there
now
I
want
some
reflections
under
this
so
I
just
grab
the
bottom
of
it
and
pull
it
straight
down
see
that
because
the
canvas
is
wet
you
can
do
this
and
get
away
with
it
if
you
had
a
dry
canvas
you'd
be
an
agony
city
then
go
gently
across
just
like
so
see
an
instant
reflections
that
easy
maybe
maybe
in
our
world
back
here
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
tree
that
lives
right
here
a
little
evergreen
tree
see
just
touch
and
then
use
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
work
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
and
we
got
a
little
tree
maybe
he's
got
a
friend
here
it's
a
little
bigger
but
they're
sure
he
needs
a
friend
too
there
he
is
I
see
I'm
sort
of
weird
had
a
name
all
these
little
trees
and
talked
to
them
but
that's
ok
that's
ok
artists
you're
supposed
to
be
a
little
a
little
different
there
so
we
can
get
away
with
things
like
it
may
be
out
here
there's
a
little
baby
tree
maybe
they
ran
him
off
me
and
go
live
out
here
by
itself
all
kinds
of
things
get
another
fan
brush
I
have
several
of
them
going
so
I
don't
have
to
continue
to
clean
them
we'll
take
a
little
that
same
color
we
made
the
tree
out
of
and
go
into
some
CAD
yellow
and
that'll
turn
a
beautiful
green
color
because
there's
blue
in
there
there
ok
let's
go
up
here
now
then
I
just
want
to
put
the
indication
here
and
there
some
little
grassy
areas
at
a
far
far
away
back
here
just
a
few
it's
too
far
away
to
get
a
lot
of
detail
and
grab
that
and
lift
upward
make
it
look
like
little
distant
trees
see
that
paint
moves
on
there
there
we
go
all
kinds
a
little
tight
little
yellow
ocher
in
there
too
what
the
heck
maybe
we'll
have
some
nice
fall
looking
colors
in
this
painting
with
all
the
shiny
colors
little
liquid
white
to
pull
it
out
flat
and
then
just
cut
across
okay
now
then
my
dad
we
can
just
come
right
up
in
here
then
we'll
just
cut
in
a
happy
little
water
act
like
you're
just
trying
to
cut
a
hole
right
through
the
canvas
back
and
forth
this
canvas
is
tough
chances
are
you
couldn't
hurt
it
if
you
wanted
to
maybe
there's
a
little
Ripple
lives
out
here
and
one
out
here
wherever
you
want
okay
yeah
then
tell
you
what
I
like
doing
those
trees
let's
do
another
one
back
into
my
dark
color
with
the
fan
brush
load
a
lot
of
color
let's
go
up
here
maybe
their
lives
and
our
world
a
bigger
evergreen
here
big
strong
side
oh
yeah
use
a
corner
of
the
brush
it
just
make
the
bristles
Bend
downward
and
I'm
using
the
same
core
of
the
brush
all
the
way
through
the
tree
I'm
just
pushing
harder
and
harder
so
it
uses
more
and
more
of
the
brush
there
this
little
rascal
spit
right
turn
your
fan
brush
or
you
can
do
another
one
or
two
mr.
Bray
tell
you
what
let's
have
a
third
tree
being
have
as
many
trees
as
we
wanted
here
now
I'm
gonna
get
over
here
and
find
me
a
one-inch
brush
go
right
through
that
same
color
and
let's
put
out
let's
put
a
happy
little
Bush
right
here
sort
of
have
to
begin
making
some
decisions
here
where
do
you
want
all
these
little
things
to
live
there
we
go
that's
super
you
can
do
it
now
then
underneath
here
we're
going
to
want
some
reflection
so
just
reverse
the
brush
where
I've
been
pushing
upward
now
I'll
push
downward
where
you
have
tall
items
up
on
top
you
want
items
that
are
long
below
it
where
they're
short
then
make
these
not
so
long
you
leave
that
oh
okay
and
those
will
turn
in
hopefully
to
some
very
nice
little
reflections
just
a
nice
clean
dry
brush
I
just
like
to
beat
on
the
brush
and
pull
straight
down
very
lightly
so
I
have
to
do
just
touch
pull
downward
and
then
go
across
okay
and
and
it
will
take
my
knife
a
little
bit
of
dark
see
a
little
white
into
it
and
get
a
very
small
roll
of
paint
on
the
knife
okay
now
then
let's
go
up
here
just
put
the
indication
here
in
there
of
a
few
little
trunks
and
these
trees
give
them
give
them
some
nice
trunks
like
stand
up
strong
and
tall
there
we
go
and
we
go
back
to
our
fan
brush
it
has
the
green
on
it
there
and
I
just
want
to
put
the
indication
of
a
few
little
highlights
on
these
trees
don't
kill
all
the
dark
oh
that
dark
contrast
hmm
well
we
get
finish
that's
what
makes
no
sign
of
again
stand
out
they're
just
a
little
evergreens
are
normally
darker
than
other
triest
so
leave
them
that
way
no
dip
the
brush
into
a
small
amount
of
the
liquid
white
and
begin
applying
some
color
to
these
things
pull
the
brush
in
one
direction
be
right
back
get
some
SAP
green
here
there
we
go
satin
green
CAD
yellow
one
direction
load
the
bristles
full
of
color
let's
go
up
here
now
you
have
to
make
some
decisions
where
did
your
little
bushes
live
just
touch
and
give
a
little
little
push
just
enough
to
bend
the
bristles
a
tiny
bit
will
alternate
some
of
the
colors
here
I
went
into
a
little
yellow
ochre
now
we
can
reverse
the
brush
and
drop
a
little
bit
right
in
there
if
you
want
to
right
in
there
may
be
up
in
here
there's
a
darker
green
living
there
yes
there
it
is
Marius
see
there's
a
big
strong
bush
over
here
he's
my
friend
there
okay
and
another
one
but
notice
how
these
are
going
in
into
layer
so
those
layers
those
layers
little-endian
yellow
-
or
what
create
the
illusion
of
depth
in
your
bushes
person
drop
in
a
few
say
there
just
reverse
your
brush
and
they
don't
have
to
be
exact
just
a
general
shape
a
little
bright
red
once
in
a
while
-
oh
that's
a
pretty
one
setting
over
here
in
the
corner
and
we
reverse
hit
run
into
the
water
now
then
with
our
clean
dry
to
itch
brush
just
barely
touch
the
top
just
graze
it
just
barely
very
touch
and
then
go
across
and
that
makes
those
beautiful
mirror
reflections
that
easy
okay
thought
you'd
like
it
it's
always
fun
I'm
going
to
some
Van
Dyck
Brown
let's
put
some
land
into
here
shoes
need
something
for
all
these
little
bushes
and
trees
to
stand
oh
the
one
to
fall
over
here
in
the
water
to
make
a
big
splash
there
we
go
and
we
takes
a
little
brown
add
a
little
white
to
it
then
come
back
just
add
it
in
the
case
not
a
few
highlights
here
just
here
and
there
it's
very
early
crazy
just
crazy
then
with
our
little
fan
brush
that
had
the
greens
and
yellows
on
it
then
come
back
and
break
up
that
straight
line
just
lets
little
grassy
areas
run
right
down
on
the
land
a
little
liquid
white
on
the
knife
and
we
can
cut
in
a
water
line
just
drop
it
in
these
lines
basically
straight
even
though
they
follow
the
land
you
want
them
to
be
straight
or
your
water
will
look
like
it's
gonna
run
right
out
of
the
painting
there
we
come
okay
let's
have
some
nuts
has
some
fun
I
got
this
whole
other
side
to
do
over
here
take
the
2
inch
brush
go
right
into
my
dark
color
a
lot
of
paint
on
the
bristles
canvas
go
up
here
maybe
on
this
side
let's
get
brave
this
is
your
bravery
test
today
I'd
like
to
give
those
over
here
lives
a
big
tree
I
don't
think
I
have
to
say
that
again
that's
why
it's
pretty
evident
that's
a
big
tree
yes
this
will
really
check
your
bravery
out
Hey
yes
there
yes
this
by
virtue
of
it
being
so
big
it
just
indicates
that
this
tree
is
much
closer
to
you
and
that
helps
create
the
illusion
that
there
may
be
a
little
tree
we
back
here
somewhere
it's
just
as
big
but
it's
far
far
away
about
being
far
away
as
you
know
it
looks
smaller
there
we
go
and
we
can
just
fill
that
all
up
this
year
to
put
them
with
a
paint
roller
doesn't
matter
that's
a
good
place
to
practice
your
strokes
tell
you
what
sometimes
we
avoid
this
whole
big
brush
and
it's
a
super
brush
it'll
do
fantastic
things
for
you
let's
load
it
to
a
chiseled
edge
both
sides
full
of
paint
same
old
dark
color
but
a
lot
of
painting
the
bristles
it
takes
a
lot
of
paint
to
stick
all
these
bristles
together
see
how
sharp
that
Sun
organ
is
there
now
then
with
that
brush
maybe
there's
a
large
evergreen
chew
where
is
now
that's
right
there
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
to
begin
working
back
and
forth
and
forth
like
so
let's
make
a
big
evergreen
tree
that
lives
right
here
in
front
of
your
mouth
maybe
he's
got
a
little
crew
kidding
there
I
love
trees
that
are
so
crooked
there
okay
let's
put
a
tree
trunk
in
there
for
that
will
this
use
dark
sand
and
white
sink
thing
we
used
on
the
other
side
there
and
since
the
fan
brush
already
has
all
that
green
on
it
we
can
use
it
to
just
put
in
indication
of
some
highlights
pop
too
many
too
many
there
we
go
so
you
don't
have
to
paint
the
whole
trunk
because
you
won't
see
the
whole
truck
all
right
now
let
me
find
another
fan
brush
here
there's
one
what
take
some
fan
deck
Brown
let's
build
the
indication
of
just
a
tree
trunk
in
here
soon
like
so
we
can
just
make
out
a
tree
trunk
or
two
in
there
and
we'll
go
into
my
liquid
white
and
into
some
yellow
and
some
SAP
green
pull
that
brush
through
load
a
lot
of
color
a
lot
of
color
get
a
little
more
green
on
it
there
we
go
a
lot
of
paint
now
there
let's
go
up
here
barely
touching
begin
laying
in
this
large
tree
don't
let
the
brush
slide
just
push
but
the
bristles
bend
a
little
and
just
begin
forming
your
individual
shapes
here
don't
just
hit
these
at
random
think
about
think
about
all
those
little
happy
limbs
that
live
in
here
there
we
go
see
all
these
things
are
there
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
push
him
out
of
your
brush
hmm
super
okay
maybe
over
here
add
a
little
yellow
ochre
maybe
there's
a
wish
it
lives
right
here
to
sort
of
pick
them
out
now
there
okay
pick
up
a
little
more
green
a
little
more
green
and
right
here
this
one's
more
in
shadow
so
it's
darker
there
we
go
see
he
just
hides
right
in
there
layer
after
layer
there
little
more
color
on
the
brush
and
reload
the
brush
is
necessary
is
you
use
up
the
paint
in
it
add
some
more
okay
tell
you
what
maybe
there's
a
big
path
in
there
take
some
van
Dyck
Brown
and
you
have
to
make
a
big
decision
here
where's
your
path
left
maybe
your
path
lives
right
there
so
it'll
a
a
basic
shape
just
using
the
brown
we
don't
know
where
this
path
goes
it
goes
up
here
and
hides
behind
the
bushes
somewhere
just
basic
shape
and
then
we'll
take
some
white
little
dark
sienna
and
let's
come
back
in
here
and
just
let
this
barely
barely
graze
just
mmm
okay
that's
just
like
putting
snow
on
the
mountain
it's
the
same
same
exact
technique
a
little
more
the
liquid
white
back
into
my
yellows
and
greens
adding
you
have
to
start
making
decisions
are
these
bushes
in
front
evergreen
or
behind
I
think
they're
in
front
so
let
them
come
right
over
it
right
over
in
front
of
it
they're
very
your
colors
and
drop
them
in
there
wants
to
out
drop
in
a
little
yellow
ochre
Indian
yellow
a
little
bright
red
there's
a
sparkler
right
there
beautiful
little
push
another
little
green
one
and
as
many
as
you
want
but
working
layers
remember
that
these
bushes
are
individuals
did
one
at
a
time
there
we
go
I
said
now
you
let
some
of
these
things
come
up
over
the
path
that'll
push
the
path
down
into
your
painting
don't
want
that
path
just
to
float
around
leave
here
and
then
we
can
take
the
knife
and
just
scrape
down
a
few
little
sticks
and
twigs
here
there
and
shoot
you've
got
a
finish
painting
I
hope
you've
enjoyed
this
one
it'll
certainly
teach
you
how
to
use
all
the
equipment
and
have
a
lot
of
fun
from
all
of
us
happy
painting
and
God
bless
you
