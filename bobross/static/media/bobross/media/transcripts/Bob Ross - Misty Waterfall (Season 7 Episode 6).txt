hi
hey
welcome
back
certainly
glad
you
could
join
me
today
today
I
thought
we'd
do
a
fantastic
little
waterfall
you
know
we've
done
several
waterfalls
in
the
past
but
I
still
get
hundreds
of
letters
from
people
wanting
to
do
waterfalls
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
more
popular
subject
matters
so
I
thought
we'd
do
one
today
I've
already
covered
the
canvas
with
a
thin
even
coated
the
liquid
white
it's
wet
slick
ready
to
go
and
now
let's
have
them
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
paint
this
project
with
me
and
they'll
come
across
in
the
same
order
that
I
have
them
on
the
palette
starting
with
a
white
and
working
around
let's
go
on
up
here
and
get
started
I'm
gonna
start
today
with
a
little
bit
of
the
black
and
a
little
bit
of
phthalo
blue
and
we
just
mix
them
together
on
the
brush
here
blue
and
black
just
brush
mix
them
okay
let's
go
right
up
to
the
sky
here
let's
just
put
a
happy
little
sky
in
here
just
just
dance
the
brush
around
let
it
play
let
it
have
fun
there
see
it
just
make
little
criss-cross
strokes
with
it
and
start
at
the
top
work
downward
that
way
it
picks
up
the
liquid
white
and
automatically
your
sky
gets
lighter
in
value
as
you
work
downward
there
we
go
and
in
landscapes
and
landscapes
you
always
want
things
to
get
darker
as
they
get
closer
to
you
toward
the
horizon
out
here
it
should
be
much
lighter
in
value
while
we
have
that
old
dirty
brush
here
I'm
gonna
take
an
add
a
little
bit
of
phthalo
green
a
little
bit
more
of
the
blue
a
little
black
we're
just
once
again
just
mix
them
on
the
brush
let's
go
right
down
here
we're
gonna
have
some
water
down
here
let's
just
apply
some
color
to
the
canvas
maybe
we
were
just
like
this
in
and
we'll
make
the
big
decisions
later
where
it's
gonna
be
wherever
right
now
all
we're
looking
for
is
some
nice
dark
color
need
the
dark
in
order
to
show
light
okay
now
let's
watch
this
two-inch
brush
and
we
wash
our
brushes
with
odorless
thinner
and
as
I
said
many
times
before
it
really
really
paid
you
to
use
odorless
thinner
okay
shake
it
off
I
didn't
see
just
just
to
really
beat
the
devil
out
of
it
cameraman
told
me
for
this
story
if
I
covered
him
one
more
time
he
was
gonna
walk
out
here
and
get
me
so
he's
about
fed
up
with
this
okay
now
with
a
clean
dry
brush
we'll
just
take
and
very
gently
blend
all
this
together
just
blend
it
together
be
sure
your
brush
is
dry
I've
got
a
little
hair
right
there
I'll
just
pop
it
right
off
there
if
you
get
a
hair
on
your
canvas
just
take
the
corner
of
your
brush
and
lift
it
off
don't
try
to
take
it
off
with
your
fingers
you'll
you'll
end
up
messing
up
your
whole
painting
trying
to
get
that
rascal
off
there
okay
that's
down
here
we
really
don't
care
much
about
right
now
it's
just
color
alright
I'm
gonna
take
a
another
brush
and
I
have
several
of
them
going
so
I
don't
have
to
continually
wash
him
same
brush
it's
just
a
two
inch
brush
I'm
gonna
pull
it
right
through
some
white
add
a
little
red
to
that
will
brighten
this
up
a
little
bit
of
red
tiny
bit
pull
that
brush
one
direction
loaded
full
look
at
all
the
painters
in
the
bristles
good
let's
go
up
to
the
canvas
I'll
put
a
happy
little
cloud
in
the
sky
today
I'm
just
gonna
take
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
just
just
let
it
bounce
around
let
them
play
let
them
have
fun
clouds
are
very
free
very
free
just
let
him
go
like
so
that
like
it
that's
enough
clouds
for
this
payment
just
throw
them
in
let
me
clean
the
brush
just
scrub
it
off
just
go
hook
it
up
give
it
a
good
wrap
and
you're
in
business
again
all
right
now
I'm
gonna
use
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
here
and
gently
gently
blend
the
bottom
of
this
cloud
I
don't
want
to
touch
the
top
just
the
bottom
blend
it
out
a
little
bit
to
us
blend
it
I
want
this
to
be
a
nice
bright
cloud
just
lives
up
here
in
the
sky
and
has
fun
okay
then
that
just
cleans
off
the
excess
paint
he
painted
I
picked
up
just
by
beating
the
bristles
you
can
you
can
clean
it
without
going
through
the
whole
procedure
now
we'll
fluff
it
up
and
very
lightly
this
is
just
barely
barely
caressing
the
canvas
just
graze
the
canvas
and
that
easy
you
have
a
beautiful
little
cloud
okay
and
then
let's
have
some
who
puts
a
little
background
trees
in
here
and
for
that
I'll
mix
up
a
lavender
color
we'll
use
some
alizarin
crimson
a
little
bit
of
phthalo
blue
proportionately
much
more
crimson
than
blue
the
blue
is
many
times
stronger
so
more
crimson
and
blue
alright
let
me
clean
my
knife
off
and
let's
load
up
this
whole
round
brush
and
to
do
that
all
I'm
gonna
do
is
just
tap
it
just
tap
it
right
there
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
then
decide
decide
where
you
want
a
happy
little
tree
to
be
maybe
there's
one
that
lives
right
there
and
think
about
the
shapes
lay
in
some
very
basic
little
shapes
here
we're
just
tapping
these
in
just
have
fun
let
him
go
wherever
you
want
this
is
your
creation
so
you
have
to
make
these
decisions
make
them
different
sizes
in
different
shapes
trees
are
like
people
they're
all
all
different
now
we
can
take
a
clean
brush
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
of
a
little
mist
here
so
I'm
just
come
on
tap
it
just
on
the
bottom
just
really
raise
Cain
now
if
you
happen
to
put
too
much
color
in
here
and
it
doesn't
work
add
a
little
titanium
white
to
your
brush
when
you
do
it
it's
better
to
use
just
a
little
paint
and
allow
it
to
blend
with
a
liquid
white
this
underneath
though
it
gives
you
much
more
natural
appearance
here
then
I'll
just
lift
up
a
little
and
that
creates
the
illusion
of
a
little
mist
and
if
you
go
back
we
can
take
the
same
color
and
now
we
can
add
in
some
little
bushes
or
a
little
closer
and
see
that
little
misty
area
right
there
separates
it
it's
the
same
color
it's
just
that
the
mist
separates
and
we
can
create
several
layers
of
little
bushy
things
okay
there
we
go
and
then
maybe
on
the
bottom
of
this
one
a
little
bit
of
mist
also
and
you
can
create
layer
after
layer
after
layer
after
layer
of
these
just
blend
it
out
and
easy
yeah
then
I'm
gonna
take
my
lighter
brush
with
a
little
bit
of
paint
thinner
on
it
and
I'm
gonna
go
there
it
is
right
into
a
little
bit
of
brown
a
little
bit
of
Van
Dyck
Brown
just
turn
that
brush
until
it
comes
to
a
nice
sharp
point
like
yet
see
how
sharp
it
is
goodness
go
up
here
don't
put
the
indication
in
here
a
few
little
tree
trunks
now
this
is
quite
a
ways
back
in
the
distance
so
we're
not
looking
for
a
lot
of
detail
yet
as
we
work
forward
then
we'll
begin
worrying
about
detail
back
here
we
just
want
to
give
some
indications
decide
how
many
trunks
live
in
your
trees
put
them
in
them
in
there
you
go
and
I
think
I
said
on
one
of
the
earlier
shows
it's
almost
unbelievable
to
me
now
that
we
have
it
with
a
complete
stew
this
series
over
90
half-hour
shows
that's
that's
so
fantastic
if
you
haven't
got
to
see
all
the
shows
give
your
local
station
a
call
tell
them
you'd
like
to
see
them
if
you
enjoy
the
shows
I
don't
know
that's
the
only
way
they
have
of
going
there
we
go
because
all
the
past
shows
are
available
to
them
they
can
get
them
if
they're
they
know
you
want
them
ok
yeah
we
got
the
indication
of
some
tree
trunks
let's
take
I'll
just
use
the
same
old
dirty
round
brush
and
we're
right
into
a
little
bit
of
the
yellows
little
yellow
ocher
pick
up
some
SAP
green
same
old
dirty
brush
I
don't
care
just
tap
it
in
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
then
this
is
far
away
I
don't
want
a
whole
bunch
of
highlight
I
just
want
enough
so
you
can
make
out
a
a
little
indication
of
some
color
here
and
there
don't
overkill
this
works
so
nice
it's
easy
to
get
carried
away
and
you
cover
up
all
the
dark
areas
and
you
lose
you
lose
the
depth
lose
the
distance
but
yellow
ochre
and
into
that
same
color
right
see
I'm
easy
and
then
you
can
just
begin
deciding
where
they
are
but
in
all
kinds
of
happy
little
things
there's
one
and
just
think
about
shape
here
when
you're
doing
these
don't
just
didn't
don't
you
just
hit
it
random
think
about
shape
it's
like
when
I
was
a
kid
my
uncle
used
to
tell
me
you
know
I
wanted
to
catch
a
rabbit
he
said
well
he
said
you
stand
behind
a
tree
and
make
a
noise
like
a
carrot
when
he
comes
by
you
grabbing
so
that's
what
you
got
to
do
here
you
gotta
think
like
a
tree
I
didn't
catch
many
rabbits
if
you're
interested
there
we
go
maybe
down
here
there's
some
little
ones
okay
yeah
I
wouldn't
I
would
want
catch
a
little
rabbit
anyway
I
think
you're
too
cute
all
right
enough
for
that
enough
for
that
now
then
that
gives
us
a
nice
little
background
and
all
we're
looking
for
is
just
some
background
so
we
can
we
can
really
concentrate
on
the
waterfall
gonna
go
right
into
some
good
dark
color
maybe
our
waterfall
is
gonna
be
in
this
area
somewhere
maybe
it's
gonna
drop
right
off
in
there
how's
that
just
drop
it
off
wherever
somewhere
in
there
and
then
we'll
have
some
dark
color
down
here
we
really
don't
care
at
this
point
let's
take
some
rayon
we'll
use
some
Van
Dyck
Brown
and
some
of
the
dark
sienna
mixed
together
I'll
just
mix
it
right
here
pull
it
out
very
flat
cut
across
see
there's
a
little
roll
of
paint
there
you
can
see
it
a
little
tiny
roll
of
paint
right
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
I
guess
go
up
here
now
with
that
that
let's
put
some
stones
and
some
rocks
and
something's
got
to
contain
this
water
I'll
always
remember
this
water
has
to
be
contained
otherwise
it'll
just
run
everywhere
I've
got
to
have
some
stones
and
rocks
and
all
kinds
of
little
little
happy
things
okay
yeah
then
we'll
take
a
little
wide
Lizzie
Anna
color
mix
it
together
I'm
gonna
put
just
a
little
touch
of
red
into
it
like
it
cut
across
let's
go
up
here
and
let's
put
let's
put
a
few
little
highlights
on
our
stones
a
may
come
across
just
let
it
sort
of
bounce
around
and
play
this
is
such
a
delicate
touch
you're
just
hitting
the
high
points
that's
all
you're
hitting
a
heaven
time
we
get
in
here
with
a
fan
brush
and
have
some
fun
now
we
can
start
building
some
water
one
of
our
one
of
our
golden
rules
a
thin
paint
will
stick
to
a
thick
paint
so
I
take
a
little
bit
of
the
liquid
white
and
then
mix
into
the
titanium
white
right
on
the
brush
a
lot
of
paint
the
brush
is
really
full
of
paint
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
start
thinking
like
water
the
water
is
coming
right
along
here
I
do
to
do
two
2's
then
play
and
have
fun
there
water
just
it
just
flowing
along
this
little
river
just
like
so
just
just
it's
having
a
super
day
just
taking
life
easy
and
coming
along
here
and
then
and
then
right
about
here
Oh
boom
somebody
pulled
the
stopper
out
and
it
fell
and
take
the
fan
brush
come
across
and
then
drop
it
down
and
it
helps
it
helps
to
make
little
sounds
like
at
and
you
have
to
you
have
to
make
a
determination
now
how
long
is
your
waterfall
if
it
comes
to
right
here
and
take
your
fan
brush
and
watch
here
go
in
push
and
bend
it
upward
there
see
and
that
makes
that
foam
up
here
on
the
top
there
give
it
a
little
push
sometimes
it
levels
out
a
little
in
boom
may
I
say
it
really
helps
to
make
all
these
happy
little
sounds
and
think
like
water
area
goes
I
have
to
be
careful
I
get
Carrie
Lee
and
cover
up
the
whole
canvas
but
and
sometimes
there's
little
stones
that
you
can't
see
under
here
and
they
make
it
go
Boop
and
cause
other
little
things
look
there
you
need
to
the
sounds
are
they
they
really
help
they're
there
so
you
wanna
need
a
little
effect
is
okay
enough
that
I
get
carried
away
take
the
old
fan
brush
here
and
go
into
some
of
my
yellows
little
green
just
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
let's
go
up
here
now
then
I
want
to
bring
all
these
rocks
and
stuff
together
so
I'll
push
Bend
that
brush
just
like
we
did
to
make
the
foamy
water
it
will
make
some
indications
of
some
happy
little
grassy
areas
that
are
just
living
right
there
if
you
have
trouble
making
your
paint
stick
add
a
little
bit
of
paint
thinner
or
a
little
bit
of
liquid
white
to
it
and
let's
just
disappear
back
in
here
see
goes
right
back
into
that
mist
I
don't
know
where
it
goes
don't
care
alright
and
that's
one
of
the
simplest
little
ways
there
is
to
make
a
waterfall
now
let's
uh
put
something
here
to
contain
that
water
once
again
you
have
to
keep
keep
it
in
the
school
right
up
here
and
maybe
this
comes
right
around
my
kiss
and
there's
a
big
oh
yeah
there
it
is
looky
there
looky
there
Bob
you
just
messed
up
now
we'll
put
some
big
old
stones
right
there
laughter
there
this
is
just
straight
Van
Dyke
Brown
quiet
a
bit
of
paint
quite
a
bit
of
paint
we'll
take
it
to
that
there
we
don't
know
now
we
also
need
something
on
the
other
side
if
we're
gonna
keep
this
water
contained
I
don't
want
to
lose
all
that
so
maybe
we'll
just
let
it
pop
up
come
right
across
I
can
there
we
go
just
let
that
wherever
make
some
decision
so
just
let
this
fall
right
off
your
knife
I
don't
want
to
lose
that
pretty
little
thing
there
that
was
a
nice
happening
see
a
lot
of
times
little
things
happen
that
you
didn't
really
plan
and
they
a
lot
of
times
turn
out
to
be
the
nicest
part
of
the
painting
watch
for
them
if
they
happen
treasure
them
hang
on
to
him
hanging
on
to
here
we
go
now
then
take
a
little
a
little
de
Brown
by
now
and
white
mix
it
together
about
like
so
pull
it
out
very
flat
cut
across
and
once
again
I
have
a
small
small
little
rule
of
paint
right
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
let's
go
up
here
I
want
to
make
the
top
of
this
sort
of
flat
looking
so
I
can
plant
some
bushes
and
stuff
up
here
so
just
grazing
it
and
angles
are
very
very
important
very
very
important
maybe
there's
a
Ledge
it
comes
right
down
through
there
look
at
the
angle
though
the
angle
is
more
important
than
any
other
thing
in
this
you
want
to
keep
us
looking
halfway
level
I
have
a
flat
let's
do
the
same
thing
basically
over
here
yes
maybe
this
one's
got
a
big
thing
just
sort
of
let
it
happen
and
see
what
happens
and
go
from
there
there
all
right
now
then
I'm
gonna
take
a
little
bit
of
white
some
blue
and
black
mix
up
a
very
dark
color
I'm
gonna
use
a
little
knife
cut
across
we
get
that
small
roll
of
paint
on
yet
also
just
a
very
tiny
one
now
the
little
knife
it
comes
in
handy
for
getting
into
little
places
like
yes
using
almost
no
color
though
just
again
looking
making
determination
see
how
that
that's
what
separates
maybe
this
one
here
comes
out
and
then
goes
bloop
no
pressure
very
little
paint
want
to
keep
this
area
very
dark
very
dark
same
thing
over
here
just
let
it
bounce
along
and
play
sometimes
you
can
grab
it
and
go
this
way
all
kinds
of
happy
little
rocks
and
there
is
something
right
there
just
wherever
you
want
it
just
give
some
happy
indications
that's
all
you
need
there
we're
all
right
now
let's
use
the
a
little
more
the
liquid
white
and
some
titanium
white
and
we
can
begin
bringing
some
water
up
around
the
foots
here
and
hit
it
splash
if
you
don't
make
it
look
like
waters
dripping
down
do
it
backwards
take
your
brush
and
go
you
see
there
it
looks
like
it's
coming
down
sneaky
huh
we
like
it
well
this
Frank
I
don't
know
here
there
some
there
maybe
that
just
keeps
right
on
coming
there
wherever
you
want
it
all
these
happy
little
things
I
had
it
go
through
here
I
let
her
decide
what
else
is
gonna
be
in
this
painting
just
keep
flaming
this
water
and
having
fun
I'm
gonna
have
a
whole
canvas
for
the
water
tell
you
what
tell
you
what
maybe
there's
a
nice
big
trees
that
grow
over
here
on
the
side
I
just
got
no
dirty
2
inch
brush
here
I'll
use
some
brown
some
crimson
some
SAP
green
doesn't
matter
whatever
load
a
lot
of
paint
into
the
brush
just
go
up
to
the
canvas
now
start
thinking
about
some
basic
shapes
maybe
there's
a
happy
tree
and
he
lives
right
here
and
his
arms
just
hang
out
over
look
at
that
and
it's
really
nice
if
you
don't
get
too
carried
away
and
you
let
some
sky
show
through
it
really
helps
gives
painting
a
little
more
depth
makes
it
a
little
more
interesting
I
just
let
some
sky
hang
through
okay
we're
gonna
put
a
bush
out
there
there
he
is
okay
let's
separate
all
those
with
with
highlights
no
big
deal
at
this
point
and
a
big
thing
here
you're
just
looking
for
a
dark
color
it's
no
no
biggie
whatever
you
have
just
whatever
don't
worry
about
it
too
much
nice
dark
color
maybe
we'll
bring
this
down
there
wherever
you
want
I
think
the
other
side
or
to
have
some
too
we
don't
want
it
to
get
jealous
maybe
there's
a
beautiful
big
tree
that
lives
here
he
hangs
out
hangs
out
that's
what
I
was
doing
as
a
teenager
just
hang
out
that
was
the
most
exciting
thing
to
do
I
guess
it
still
is
yeah
one
of
the
earlier
shows
we
showed
you
some
of
the
paintings
that
people
are
doing
along
with
us
oh
I
think
that's
so
fantastic
I'm
looking
forward
to
doing
that
again
let
me
hear
from
you
let
me
know
if
you
like
seeing
one
what
people
all
over
the
country
are
doing
with
this
fantastic
fantastic
painting
method
let
me
know
in
a
few
if
you
enjoy
seeing
that
kind
of
thing
I'll
continue
to
bring
you
some
more
because
we
get
all
kinds
of
letters
with
paintings
and
some
of
them
are
almost
unbelievable
and
I'd
love
to
share
them
with
you
all
right
we're
going
to
a
little
bit
of
brown
I'm
gonna
load
the
brush
with
brown
and
then
Diana
will
go
right
down
here
and
load
one
side
with
white
okay
so
I
have
brown
and
white
see
there
just
go
up
here
now
let's
put
let's
put
some
little
trunks
in
here
there
they
are
a
double
loading
the
brush
the
brown
and
the
white
you
get
both
sides
of
the
trunk
at
one
time
in
that
sneaky
for
us
lazy
people
it's
great
and
that
it's
me
there
maybe
maybe
maybe
there's
a
little
ailment
lives
in
there
then
you
don't
have
to
be
too
careful
here
because
the
leaves
are
gonna
cover
most
oh
so
you
know
you
don't
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
worry
I'll
take
a
little
bit
of
liquid
like
maybe
right
in
here
there's
a
happy
little
Oh
little
thing
it
lives
right
there
like
so
and
you
just
put
as
many
up
in
here
as
you
want
wherever
wherever
don't
decide
to
get
jealous
keep
the
continuity
here
a
little
bit
just
put
one
over
here
all
right
now
we
need
we
need
some
dirt
down
here
for
all
this
to
settle
I'll
go
right
into
some
Brown
really
are
say
just
lay
it
in
make
a
decision
where
you
want
it
and
drop
it
in
you
know
so
many
of
these
shows
are
designed
from
cards
and
letters
that
we
receive
and
people
they
tell
us
what
they
want
to
see
so
if
you
have
a
favorite
subject
or
something
drop
me
a
line
let
me
know
what
you
want
to
see
if
I
can't
do
it
son
of
a
gun
maybe
we'll
just
go
out
and
find
somebody
to
can
there
we
are
kidding
a
little
bit
of
highlight
on
there
just
touching
with
a
light
color
barely
grazing
the
canvas
don't
overdo
don't
all
we
do
just
bear
to
touch
you
to
want
to
kill
that
nice
dark
Harriet
you
put
in
there
all
right
tell
you
what
let's
put
some
let's
put
a
little
of
the
liquid
white
go
right
into
some
yellow
a
little
SAP
green
and
roll
load
this
brush
by
tapping
attacking
you
see
that
here
you
go
tap
it
just
go
right
up
here
now
then
this
is
where
we
put
the
sparkles
on
the
tree
these
are
the
little
leaves
all
the
volatile
goodies
I'm
gonna
add
a
little
paint
thinner
to
my
brush
to
make
it
paint
a
tiny
bit
thinner
then
paint
sticks
to
a
thick
paint
just
drop
them
in
wherever
you
want
to
whatever
see
you
there

I'm
gonna
grab
a
a
one-inch
brush

back
here

a
little
yellow
and
some
red

was
a
little
bush

lived
out
here

this
stone

few
more
things
on
this
tree
and
you
just
put
as
many
leaves
in
yours
as
you
want
let's
put
some
on
the
other
side
there
they
come
just
let
him
drop
right
off
that
brush
I'm
using
mostly
the
corner
to
brush
going
to
CAD
yellow
bed

bit
of
yellow
ochre
what's
an
awesome
Hindi
yellow
whatever

the
yellows

heads

just
let
it
bounce
around
and
play
there

put
some
individuals
I'll
use
this
thing

one-inch

it
through
a
little
lotta

happy
little
tree

lives
right
