painting
at
home

come
across
as
usual
in
the
same
orders
I
have
them
on
the
palette
starting
with
the
white
and
working
around
while
they're
doing
that
that's
going
up
here
in
the
canvas
and
talked
a
little
bit
I'll
tell
you
what
I
like
to
share
things
with
you
I've
got
to
show
you
a
picture
of
the
youngest
painter
that
I
have
met
lately
and
this
is
this
is
William
and
William
I
met
in
Springfield
Missouri
he's
four
years
old
and
he
is
fantastic
painter
he
brought
his
picture
and
let
me
see
it
and
certainly
glad
to
have
William
working
with
us
now
the
canvas
is
an
18
by
24
and
I've
completely
covered
it
with
it
then
even
coated
the
liquid
white
so
it's
all
slick
and
it's
ready
to
go
you
let's
do
it
let's
start
out
today
with
a
least
little
touch
least
little
touch
of
cad
yellow
into
the
large
brush
just
tap
a
little
color
in
there
okay
and
you
have
to
make
a
decision
right
off
today
where's
your
horizon
going
to
be
let's
make
it
right
about
here
let's
do
it
such
a
beautiful
day
let's
do
a
fantastic
bright
shiny
painting
today
once
it'll
make
you
happy
a
little
bit
of
yellow
in
there
let
it
blend
with
a
liquid
white
now
without
cleaning
the
brush
I'm
going
back
into
yellow
ochre
just
tap
a
little
bit
of
the
yellow
ochre
right
into
the
same
little
dirty
brush
okay
now
right
above
the
yellow
could
add
a
little
touch
of
the
yellow
okay
just
like
so
and
let
it
blend
right
and
also
so
easy
that
is
now
without
cleaning
the
brush
I'm
going
into
touch
of
bright
red
chest
to
touch
it's
very
very
strong
it'll
lead
up
your
whole
world
in
one
heartbeat
right
along
here
add
a
little
touch
of
your
rib
and
just
sort
of
let
it
play
on
the
out
through
here
wherever
where
let
it
have
fun
now
with
what
little
is
left
on
the
brush
I'm
just
gonna
mix
it
with
a
little
bit
of
liquid
right
on
the
canvas
and
just
make
sort
of
a
nice
little
peachy
color
right
here
yeah
very
lightly
we
can
blend
all
this
together
so
we
have
layers
of
cover
okay
same
old
dirty
brush
add
a
little
titanium
white
and
will
go
right
here
I
want
this
area
right
in
here
to
be
nice
and
bright
and
shiny
so
I'm
going
to
add
the
street
titanium
white
and
work
it
in
now
when
this
is
done
for
this
area
would
be
bright
and
shiny
it
doesn't
look
shiny
now
because
it's
against
a
light
background
we're
gonna
put
some
dark
colors
in
there
and
then
it'll
happen
okay
let's
take
us
a
little
bit
of
alizarin
crimson
and
some
phthalo
blue
lizard
crimson
they
low
blue
proportionately
we
need
much
more
crimson
than
blue
just
mix
it
on
the
brush
let's
go
right
back
up
in
here
Alice
but
let's
make
a
nice
lavender
color
I'm
just
gonna
go
right
around
in
here
and
begin
spinning
in
just
the
indication
of
some
happy
little
cloud
shapes
here
and
there
beautiful
little
colors
happening
here
just
sort
of
work
them
in
just
makes
them
blend
them
there
make
all
kinds
of
little
things
just
happen
don't
kill
all
this
pink
leave
some
of
it
in
there
so
it
shines
through
the
clouds
okay
a
little
touch
more
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
cloud
just
sort
of
boom
there
he
comes
we'll
try
it
out
in
there
wherever
you
want
yeah
I'm
gonna
add
a
little
bit
more
than
a
little
blue
still
haven't
cleaned
the
brush
and
then
with
this
phthalo
blue
we'll
put
a
little
bit
of
blue
right
up
here
at
the
top
like
so
see
maybe
a
little
touch
right
there
just
to
bring
us
all
together
yeah
they
are
time
to
clean
the
brush
that's
the
fun
part
odorless
paint
thinner
shake
off
the
excess
and
you
totally
redecorate
the
studio
now
at
home
I
suggest
you
get
your
brush
beater
rec
and
put
it
in
the
bottom
of
a
trash
can
so
you
don't
change
your
whole
decor
in
a
matter
of
seconds
now
with
a
clean
dry
brush
I'm
going
to
begin
blending
this
entire
sky
together
just
very
gently
just
sort
of
mix
it
up
blend
it
blend
it
little
circular
strokes
crisscross
strokes
whatever
it
takes
to
make
some
nice
effects
just
sort
of
look
at
your
painting
each
painting
is
going
to
be
a
little
different
never
can
copy
the
always
individual
look
at
all
the
beautiful
things
that
are
happening
in
that
sky
now
a
super
way
to
make
a
fantastic
sky
very
quickly
and
very
easy
shoot
I
still
work
myself
to
death
try
to
create
a
sky
like
it
and
it's
easy
it's
very
easy
you
can
do
it
you
could
do
it
there
we
go
anything
that
is
weave
hair
one
dynamite
sky
beautiful
beautiful
sky
now
you
can
also
see
how
that
light
area
just
sort
of
jumps
out
at
you
after
you
put
the
dark
off
clean
the
brush
beat
the
devil
out
of
it
and
we're
ready
tell
you
what
let's
play
a
little
bit
with
a
little
oval
brush
and
I'm
going
to
go
right
in
here
let's
take
some
let's
take
some
lizard
Crimson
a
little
bit
of
black
and
some
brown
put
some
dark
sand
enter
to
cut
the
head
a
little
touch
a
white
to
lighten
up
so
we
can
see
what
we
have
that's
a
nice
color
clean
the
knife
off
I
just
clean
the
knife
on
paper
towel
so
you
wonder
where
I'm
going
over
there
okay
this
is
the
little
oval
brush
see
it's
around
there
you
see
it
it's
round
okay
load
a
little
pain
on
it
let's
have
a
little
footy
Hill
back
here
in
the
distance
somewhere
and
all
I'm
going
to
do
just
take
this
brush
and
tap
see
look
at
all
little
looks
like
little
treetops
far
far
away
just
hundreds
of
them
that
quick
well
that's
sneaky
huh
now
left
a
little
bit
this
yellow
underneath
because
I
want
to
I
want
to
blend
it
out
and
create
mist
and
I
want
the
mist
to
have
sort
of
a
yellowish
hue
to
it
so
it
looks
like
there's
light
playing
through
there
now
a
large
brush
I'm
just
going
to
tap
the
base
of
this
don't
touch
the
top
just
the
base
just
tapping
okay
very
lightly
very
lightly
just
lift
it
up
blend
it
together
now
I
see
the
soft
nice
misty
air
you
read
into
here
that's
what
will
help
create
the
illusion
of
distance
I'm
gonna
get
a
little
further
along
in
the
painting
and
it
kind
of
make
some
big
decisions
we'll
just
use
that
same
old
color
same
old
color
that
was
what
we
have
there
we
had
a
lizard
crimson
some
Van
Dyck
Brown
some
dark
Sienna
whatever
you
throw
a
little
black
in
there
too
if
you
want
to
all
we're
looking
for
now
it
is
a
nice
darkish
color
to
lay
down
for
a
base
coat
and
then
on
top
of
that
we'll
put
a
light
color
just
tap
the
brush
in
there
thanks
Greta
pea
now
you
have
to
make
big
decisions
let's
start
creating
some
landmasses
in
here
all
you
do
just
touch
and
tap
just
tap
it
down
right
see
they're
that
easy
that
easy
I
win
create
a
nice
little
land
area
back
here
you
don't
want
to
kill
this
misty
area
this
little
misty
area
between
the
dark
Kanda
and
the
foothill
is
the
only
thing
you
have
to
separate
you
need
to
save
that
treasure
it
it's
your
good
friend
good
good
friend
and
then
I'll
just
use
the
same
old
dirty
brush
what
the
heck
I'm
lazy
don't
like
to
clean
brushes
take
a
little
yellow
look
CAD
yellow
little
SAP
green
would
jump
over
here
and
get
some
yellow
ochre
-
what
the
heck
it
doesn't
matter
tap
the
brush
tap
it
case
go
right
up
here
now
then
let's
put
some
little
highlights
you
need
that
dark
in
order
to
make
that
light
show
see
there
look
at
that
pocket
that
you
make
beautiful
soft
little
grass
here
isn't
that
easy
and
easy
just
tap
on
it
following
the
lay
of
the
land
this
is
where
you
begin
creating
the
shape
of
your
land
so
it's
very
important
to
pay
attention
to
the
angles
here
and
that
easy
you
have
a
plain
back
you're
all
finished
up
tell
you
what
I
won't
get
a
a
new
brush
take
the
same
color
we'll
use
some
lizard
crimson
some
black
dark
Sienna
Van
Dyke
Brown
throw
a
little
SAP
greener
-
what
the
heck
along
this
dark
that's
a
big
thing
tap
the
brush
Kenny
now
I
have
to
make
another
big
decision
maybe
there's
another
plane
or
another
layer
of
land
it
comes
right
down
in
front
of
that
one
like
that
see
when
you
had
this
much
power
you
have
to
make
decisions
and
make
decisions
you
can
move
the
mountains
and
rivers
there
and
all
we're
doing
here
is
applying
the
dark
sorta
Lydell
show
there
we
go
so
easy
that
is
in
reality
you
could
put
this
on
with
a
paint
roller
all
you're
doing
is
putting
on
dark
four
base
coat
it's
going
to
be
the
shadows
it'll
be
the
shadows
and
all
the
little
grassy
areas
here
there
you're
tapping
quite
firmly
here
it's
really
this
is
where
you
take
out
all
your
hostilities
this
is
it's
a
veteran
gone
home
and
arguing
with
your
spouse
or
kicking
the
dogs
or
whatever
there
we
go
young
fellow
I
showed
you
this
beginning
a
show
he's
a
painter
really
as
I
say
I
met
him
in
Springfield
Missouri
we
we
did
a
show
there
for
the
PBS
station
and
he
came
to
see
us
fantastic
young
man
we
met
so
many
super
people
there
looking
forward
to
going
back
in
the
near
future
there
okay
I
just
got
carried
away
here
talking
to
just
cover
up
the
whole
campus
why
not
let's
just
cover
up
the
whole
campus
it
didn't
make
any
difference
there
okay
just
tap
so
I'd
like
to
leave
some
of
these
light
areas
and
here's
a
reason
I've
tap
instead
of
just
painting
all
this
because
some
of
these
the
light
areas
will
show
through
and
it
makes
just
makes
nice
looking
places
okay
tell
you
what
tell
you
what
let's
do
let's
take
you
steel
around
the
brush
we'll
have
some
fun
we'll
take
the
round
brush
and
go
right
into
some
Van
Dyck
Brown
a
little
touch
of
the
dark
sienna
and
all
I'm
doing
is
tapping
very
firmly
to
load
it
just
tap
let's
go
right
up
here
maybe
there's
a
little
clump
of
trees
live
right
in
here
do
you
live
right
in
there
now
start
at
the
bottom
and
work
up
so
to
pick
up
the
liquid
white
and
get
lighter
and
lighter
in
value
as
it
works
up
because
more
lights
come
shine
through
these
limbs
and
everything
up
here
much
more
light
there
we
go
little
touch
more
to
paint
maybe
there's
a
happy
tree
right
there
we
don't
know
just
wherever
wherever
you
want
a
little
tree
to
live
in
your
world
that's
the
right
place
for
it
that
is
the
right
place
there
we
go
already
you
got
the
basic
shape
some
nice
little
trees
yeah
let's
take
a
whole
script
liner
brush
and
I'll
just
use
something
I'll
just
use
some
paint
thinner
and
go
right
into
the
brown
we
want
to
thin
this
paint
down
till
it's
a
very
thin
turn
the
brush
turn
it
pull
it
out
that
brings
it
to
a
nice
sharp
point
let's
go
up
here
now
then
we
need
a
few
tree
trunks
in
here
there
we
go
now
if
your
paint
does
not
flow
add
a
little
more
of
the
paint
thinner
to
it
a
thin
paint
will
stick
to
a
thick
paint
maybe
there's
a
few
out
of
here
at
home
you
have
unlimited
time
you
can
just
you
can
do
a
much
better
job
you
can
put
all
kinds
of
details
and
hearing
little
tree
branches
and
limbs
and
squirrel
or
two
hair
in
there
or
you
can
get
crazy
this
is
what
a
little
bunny
rabbit
hides
out
he's
my
friend
okay
I'm
going
back
into
the
brown
right
now
it
looks
like
all
the
all
the
foliage
is
on
the
back
of
the
tree
I
want
some
on
this
side
too
so
using
the
same
color
here
and
there
I'm
just
going
to
tap
them
a
little
foliage
on
this
side
the
tree
see
that
way
then
look
like
it's
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
like
somebody
took
a
big
razor
blade
and
cut
your
tree
and
tuned
it
if
I
love
on
the
floor
here
we
go
that
easy
and
then
let's
get
us
let's
get
us
a
big
fan
brush
I'm
gonna
take
some
black
Prussian
blue
SAP
green
just
good
dark
color
here
make
setup
clean
knife
let's
take
the
old
fan
brush
and
load
it
full
of
paint
a
lot
of
paint
just
really
fill
it
up
or
look
at
that
a
lot
of
paint
in
there
okay
let's
go
up
here
now
maybe
there's
a
happy
little
evergreen
tree
who
lives
right
there
right
there
we
don't
have
anything
but
happy
trees
just
work
back
and
forth
I
see
how
this
dark
color
shows
up
against
that
light
hmm
the
contrast
there
is
beautiful
just
really
jumps
out
at
you
really
jumps
out
so
it
makes
your
paint
beautiful
can
I
tell
you
what
let's
do
let's
make
a
whole
clump
of
trees
we
you
know
want
Oh
Tree
Lane
up
here
lonely
you
get
sad
and
start
crying
nothing
worse
than
an
unhappy
tree
that
one
bite
me
one
time
a
little
okay
there
is
one
right
here
got
to
have
a
place
for
the
little
birds
to
sit
I'd
like
to
hide
in
these
kind
of
trees
they
can
hide
in
there
and
the
Hawks
and
the
stuff
can't
see
you
there
we
go
and
you
sort
of
have
to
make
a
decision
here
how
many
trees
you
want
in
your
world
tell
you
what
maybe
there's
a
tiny
one
here
then
it
won't
quit
I
just
I
get
carried
away
with
these
trees
are
so
much
fun
just
put
a
little
one
right
there
I'm
going
back
to
the
old
brush
that
has
some
of
the
yellows
and
greens
on
it
that
we
were
using
to
make
the
little
grassy
areas
let's
tap
a
little
more
that
color
in
there
go
ahead
up
here
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
of
a
little
bit
of
there
see
nice
soft
little
area
leave
and
let
that
pick
up
some
of
this
dark
color
look
at
there
just
let
it
work
right
on
out
now
all
you
have
to
do
here
is
just
tap
no
big
deal
easy
to
do
so
you
can
push
those
trees
right
back
I'm
gonna
get
darker
and
darker
darker
back
in
here
there's
a
lot
of
shadow
over
here
so
don't
add
any
new
color
just
use
that
same

this
brush

its
shape
give
it
some
character
put
someone
this
window

I
hope

all
the
little
details
at
brush
mix
there
we
go
let's
go
right
over
here
there
it
goes
and
you
can
put
as
many
as
you
want
on
there
okay
it's
such
a
nice
little
area
tell
you
what
let's
build
a
house
back
here
shoot
let's
take
some
Van
Dyke
Brown
pull
it
out
grab
a
some
other
night
it
had
to
make
a
big
decision
maybe
the
house
lives
right
there
see
right
in
front
of
our
tree
but
I
don't
yeah
we'll
come
over
here
let's
put
the
other
side
to
roof
just
like
building
the
house
there
we
go
just
lay
in
a
nice
base
color
a
dark
color
there
and
easy
now
then
I
need
a
front
on
him
in
your
world
you
look
around
you
see
what
kind
of
house
you
want
and
you
put
him
in
there
maybe
you
want
to
maybe
you
want
to
put
a
little
barred
in
yours
maybe
we'll
make
this
one
the
barn
who
knows
see
what
happens
here
so
to
look
at
it
see
making
big
decisions
later
okay
I
will
take
some
of
this
bright
red
and
some
dark
sienna
now
that
let's
put
a
red
roof
on
this
one
we'll
start
here
and
just
let
it
sort
of
bounces
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boop
right
down
got
to
make
a
little
noise
I
didn't
work
did
it
-
dude
see
there
see

roof
well
he's
like
me
he's
old

had
a
rough
life
the
rains
coming
through
on
him
man
let's
take
some
height
a
little
bit
of
the
dark
Sienna
there
very
good
let's
touch
no
pressure
old
wood
no
pressure
just
like
can
we
put
snow
on
the
mountains
no
pressure
I
like
to
teach
people
to
put
snow
on
the
mountains
because
if
you
can
do
that
then
all
this
other
other
stuff
with
a
knife
becomes
very
easy
it's
the
best
way
to
make
friends
with
that
knife
sometimes
it
is
neat
to
take
a
tiny
bit
of
a
yellow
little
yellow
and
put
in
there
see
that
need
a
little
yellow
ocher
make
it
look
old
tired
now
on
the
other
side
very
dark
very
dark
over
here
and
doing
just
a
little
indication
yeah
then
no
toca
just
appointed
a
knife
will
this
make
some
old
boards
in
here
just
falling
down
look
at
that
I
wished
it
was
that
easy
to
build
a
house
there
we
go
oh

got
two
hole
she
had
Nelligan
we
can
chop
it
up
and
get
our
perspective
right
we
just
did
a
house
ectomy
now
maybe
tell
you
what
maybe
this
old
guys
like
me

ran
out
of
room

had
to
build
him

that
easy
and
easy
hmm

a
little
shed
I'm
a
junk
collector

I'm
always
needing
a
place
to
put
all
my
stuff
there
we
go
a
little
bit
of
this
color
out
here
bring
it
all
together
your
little
boards
see
right
there
would
be
a
good
place
to
get
the
small
knife
and
sneak
right
in
there
look
at
that
little
knife
comes
in
handy
sometime
tell
you
what
I

little
knife

a
little
window

let's
put
a
little
window
right

just
cut
around
it
that'll
that
color
show
through
and
you're
in
business
they
had
easy
all
right
and
then
let's
take
let's
take
some
yellow
in
the
brush
and
now
we
can
use
this
to
sort
of
clean
up
his
foots
tap
it
all
these
little
grassy
things
here
follow
the
lay
of
the
land
I
reach
over
here
and
we'll
get
some
Indian
yellow
here
and
there
a
little
touch
of
the
brain
and
let's
let
that
all
work
together
look
they're
just
layer
after
layer
after
layer
boy
that's
one
poor
looking
over
house
carpenter
headed
by
as
much
ambition
as
I
do
it
lazy
there
we
go
another
hill
another
hill
and
as
many
as
you
want
they're
spring
some
right
down
in
here
like
so
I
tell
you
what
let's
do
here
let's
have
some
fun
maybe
give
us
a
big
gob
a
dark
color
here
some
black
and
some
blue
SAP
green
just
good
dark
color
we
don't
care
what
it
is
dead
in
there
okay
load
the
big
Brush
shuffle
we'll
have
some
fun
this
let's
do
a
big
evergreen
tree
on
the
other
side
don't
want
the
other
side
to
be
left
out
Kings
go
right
here
he
is
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
I'm
sort
of
working
back
and
forth
and
we'll
put
Oh
we'll
put
a
big
ol
tree
right
there
so
my
god
that's
a
big
tree
it's
growing
every
minute
to
time
we
get
through
where
we
may
have
a
giant
redwood
that
easy
let's
give
him
let's
give
me
one
little
friend
we
don't
want
him
to
get
lonely
over
here
that's
my
cat
we
don't
carry
we'll
separate
that
with
highlights
and
maybe
see
here
we'll
just
bring
the
landmass
right
down
through
here
just
a
little
color
in
there
and
then
click
we
get
a
little
little
color
then
we
can
take
our
yellows
greens
see
I
need
that
dark
to
make
this
stand
out
and
then
we
can
just
begin
tapping
it
layer
after
layer
after
layer
all
these
soft
little
grassy
areas
just
I
don't
go
and
the
more
you
tap
the
smoother
and
softer
they
get
I'll
go
back
to
the
old
oval
brush
load
some
of
the
green
in
it
Oh
what
tell
you
guys
we
need
a
tree
trunk
I'll
take
some
brown
and
white
put
the
indication
of
a
little
tree
trunk
like
so
and
with
the
oval
brush
put
some
look
at
there
put
some
leaves
on
this
tree
make
him
stand
out
in
the
Sun
and
shine
there
we
go
there
we
go
darker
darker
darker
as
it
goes
down
toward
the
base
right
in
here
there
Oh
kinds
of
little
things
let's
have
some
fun
what
the
heck
I'm
gonna
take
a
little
the
brown
on
my
liner
brush
maybe
back
here
in
the
distance
on
where
it
is
a
little
fence
because
I
don't
know
if
over
the
hill
we
don't
know
where
it
goes
if
you
look
indications
here
and
there
fences
are
a
lot
of
fun
to
make
I
enjoy
it
tell
you
what
let's
make
a
big
fence
I'm
running
out
of
time
here
but
we'll
do
it
anyway
what
the
heck
there's
1
2
3
mm
or
and
one
it
we
can't
even
see
the
brown
and
white
giving
a
little
highlight
like
so
and
you
can
put
a
little
fence
in
there
we
take
a
little
liquid
white
cut
across
it
just
the
heel
the
night
soon
look
at
there
in
an
easy
way
to
make
wire
and
put
as
many
strands
as
you
want
on
there
just
that
easy
I
think
we
have
one
that's
about
ready
to
sign
take
a
little
thinner
little
the
bright
red
and
will
sign
this
one
sincerely

you've
enjoyed
it

look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
next
time
and
until
then

of
us

painting

you
