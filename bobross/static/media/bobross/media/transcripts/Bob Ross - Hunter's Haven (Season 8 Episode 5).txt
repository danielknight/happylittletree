hey
welcome
back
certain
glad
you
could
join
me
again
today
got
your
pallet
set
up
let's
get
going
here
let's
start
off
them
have
them
graphically
run
all
the
colors
across
the
screen
that
you
need
to
do
this
painting
with
me
and
they'll
come
across
as
usual
in
the
same
order
that
I
have
them
on
the
palette
starting
with
a
white
and
working
around
while
they're
doing
that
let's
go
on
up
here
I've
already
covered
the
canvas
with
a
thin
even
coat
of
liquid
white
it's
nice
and
wet
and
slicking
all
ready
to
go
I
thought
maybe
today
let's
do
a
little
fall
scene
where
maybe
the
weather
is
not
too
great
you
know
and
fall
we
have
a
lot
of
rainy
weather
you
know
the
snow
is
gonna
come
pretty
soon
so
let's
do
something
like
yet
and
just
just
have
some
fun
I'm
gonna
start
out
using
a
small
small
amount
of
yellow
ochre
just
the
tiniest
a
little
bit
a
very
small
amount
and
right
here
sort
of
make
a
determination
where
the
horizon
is
gonna
be
and
I'm
gonna
begin
swinging
this
upward
just
using
these
strokes
like
so
a
little
bit
more
color
we'll
have
a
little
water
in
this
paint
as
you
know
I'm
I'm
sort
of
a
water
fanatic
you
like
that
water
little
yellow
in
here
okay
I'm
gonna
go
right
into
some
Van
Dyck
Brown
in
the
same
way
just
tap
the
brush
into
it
okay
let's
go
right
up
here
so
I'll
put
a
little
brown
right
in
here
I'm
beginning
to
create
these
sky
angles
since
don't
I
don't
get
too
too
straight
like
this
it'll
it'll
disturb
you
on
it's
done
now
I'm
gonna
take
brown
and
a
touch
of
Prussian
blue
let
me
say
that
again
a
touch
pression
blue
is
so
strong
just
a
little
bit
miss
brown
and
blue
okay
yes
begins
bringing
that
all
together
add
a
touch
of
the
midnight
black
to
it
so
now
we
have
in
the
sky
we
have
a
little
bit
of
yellow
ochre
some
Brown
sort
of
pression
blue
and
some
midnight
black
and
we're
just
gonna
sort
of
work
all
of
these
Baskerville
colors
together
try
to
keep
the
blue
off
that
yellow
or
you'll
get
a
very
greedy
sky
okay
and
then
before
we
start
blending
them
we
still
have
a
dirty
old
brush
and
we'll
take
some
more
the
pression
blue
and
a
little
bit
of
the
black
there
we
go
and
let's
go
ahead
and
lay
our
water
in
both
on
the
outside
in
see
if
you
start
if
you
start
from
here
and
go
across
watch
what
happens
you
touch
here
and
go
across
you
get
this
big
line
that's
bad
and
then
it's
hard
to
blend
out
so
starting
the
outside
and
come
over
and
that
way
you
don't
have
that
harsh
line
that
you
have
to
blend
out
there
we
go
little
tricks
like
that
save
ya
save
you
a
lot
of
agony
we
want
this
to
be
easy
we
want
it
to
work
for
you
okay
a
little
bit
more
of
the
midnight
black
impression
blue
mixture
don't
want
to
kill
all
that
nice
little
yellow
area
that
you
have
because
of
blue
and
black
go
heat
it
up
in
a
heartbeat
okay
little
darker
at
the
bottom
then
is
at
the
top
that'll
help
create
your
illusion
of
distance
okay
let
me
wash
the
old
brush
wash
the
old
brush
shake
off
excess
right
here's
the
fun
part
okay
let's
go
right
back
up
here
and
I'm
gonna
begin
blending
this
together
follow
the
angles
in
the
sky
I'm
gonna
use
long
strokes
start
in
the
light
area
and
work
up
toward
the
darker
area
that
way
you
brush
is
dirty
when
it
gets
to
the
top
use
your
clean
brush
in
the
lighter
and
you
can
just
begin
bringing
all
this
together
all
of
those
angles
though
they're
nice
and
soft
okay
that
gives
us
a
quick
happy
little
sky
down
here
we
just
go
all
the
way
across
that
straightens
out
the
water
and
brings
it
all
together
and
we're
ready
let
me
get
a
little
fan
brush
here
we'll
mix
up
let's
take
a
little
black
a
little
brown
a
tiny
bit
of
oppression
blue
and
a
little
bit
of
alizarin
crimson
into
that
I'll
put
some
white
here
and
pull
a
little
bit
of
that
into
it
maybe
I'll
add
a
little
more
blue
to
that
and
the
touch
more
crimson
there
we
go
that's
sort
of
what
I'm
looking
for
it's
a
very
dark
lavender
to
the
blue
side
it's
very
dark
it's
almost
a
gray
color
this
is
gonna
be
a
grey
cloudy
day
okay
let
me
wipe
off
my
knife
now
let's
take
the
old
fan
brush
and
go
right
through
a
little
bit
of
color
don't
need
a
lot
of
paint
on
the
brush
yes
time
just
a
little
add
a
small
amount
of
Brown
into
that
a
little
a
little
more
into
the
brownish
color
there
we
go
good
let's
go
right
up
here
now
back
in
here
you
have
to
make
a
decision
maybe
their
lives
some
happy
little
evergreens
just
take
the
corner
of
the
brush
just
back
and
forth
just
sort
of
pop
in
just
a
little
evergreen
some
indications
are
some
that
are
even
farther
away
all
we
see
is
just
the
basic
shapes
I'm
just
touching
and
sort
of
pulling
it
downward
so
you
make
all
kinds
of
little
basic
shapes
see
touch
use
a
top
part
of
the
brush
and
just
give
it
a
little
downward
snap
there
a
little
more
paint
on
the
brush
maybe
over
here
we
get
some
and
be
careful
of
these
we'll
get
looking
like
fence
posts
hmm
there
and
into
a
path
there
that's
good
enough
yeah
I'm
gonna
put
a
few
more
indications
of
some
trees
that
have
a
little
more
shape
to
them
and
we're
just
using
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
just
work
them
in
back
and
forth
these
little
trees
live
right
in
your
fan
brush
sometimes
you
have
to
sort
of
scare
them
out
there
and
you
just
put
as
many
or
as
few
as
you
wanted
your
world
there
we
go
okay
he's
got
a
little
friend
there
just
drop
them
in
yeah
then
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
of
mist
back
here
I
want
this
to
be
very
soft
and
very
distant
so
we'll
take
the
two
inch
brush
and
tap
I'm
using
a
top
corner
see
look
how
hard
is
hitting
it's
bending
really
get
in
here
and
tap
it
and
you
can
create
the
illusion
of
very
very
soft
area
back
here
you've
let
it
come
up
above
some
of
these
here
they're
really
soft
so
these
trees
are
already
there
already
just
lost
try
to
be
missed
can
you
believe
how
that
pushes
all
that
back
just
that
little
tapping
action
okay
now
then
they
let
us
have
another
plane
in
the
painting
and
a
plane
I
mean
just
another
area
that's
closer
to
you
so
we'll
take
those
same
old
colors
we'll
use
some
brown
and
we'll
put
some
dark
Sienna
in
there
this
toe
and
a
little
bit
of
SAP
green
as
things
get
closer
we'll
begin
to
see
a
little
more
detail
just
a
little
SAP
green
though
okay
brush
is
really
full
of
paint
let's
go
right
up
in
here
there
it
is
these
trees
are
a
little
closer
they're
a
little
bit
bigger
look
at
that
turn
it
over
us
over
use
both
sides
of
it
there
we
go
this
trees
stronger
he's
he
got
a
little
more
light
okay
we
don't
even
get
lonely
so
we'll
give
him
a
friend
too
you
know
friends
are
so
important
not
only
the
trees
but
to
us
and
through
painting
I
have
made
oh
I've
made
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
new
friends
all
over
the
country
and
that
may
be
the
most
rewarding
part
of
all
this
most
rewarding
part
there
I
take
you
one
here's
a
happy
little
tree
you
is
right
there
just
sort
of
just
sort
of
visualize
in
your
mind
where
you
think
3:03
you'd
be
happy
and
you
put
him
in
there
just
put
him
in
there
take
a
little
bit
of
the
dark
sienna
and
just
tap
it
onto
this
brush
and
then
I
want
to
gather
up
some
of
this
color
that
we
had
on
a
tree
and
begin
very
softly
putting
in
little
Hills
look
at
there
see
pick
up
some
of
that
tree
color
I
just
let
it
she
never
has
tab
let
it
go
there
was
a
tiny
bit
of
dark
CN
on
the
brush
tiny
bit
tiniest
little
bit
see
how
you
can
set
those
trees
out
of
fun
little
hill
and
then
you
begin
pulling
that
down
I
don't
want
this
to
be
very
very
soft
very
quiet
I
like
very
gentle
little
paintings
and
when
you're
doing
yours
at
home
if
you
want
to
be
brighter
and
stronger
just
use
a
little
stronger
color
because
painting
is
a
very
individual
thing
there
okay
now
let's
go
right
back
into
here
and
load
up
just
load
that
fan
brush
full
of
paint
okay
now
you
want
this
do
let's
have
a
tree
that
lives
right
there
yeah
we
take
just
the
corner
of
the
brush
and
begin
working
him
down
so
you
can
just
push
that
tree
right
out
of
that
brush
a
little
more
paint
to
us
push
it
hard
when
you
get
down
this
far
when
you
first
start
you're
pushing
quite
easy
by
the
time
you
get
down
here
mmm
getting
tough
with
it
strong
with
it
a
little
more
color
okay
I'll
tell
you
what
does
do
right
here
big
sign
of
a
gun
see
all
these
different
sizes
of
trees
help
create
the
illusion
of
distance
depth
in
your
painting
I
beginning
to
look
like
follow
you
sort
of
a
mean
ol
sky
changed
now
then
I
Mogu
back
into
a
little
tiny
tiny
a
little
bit
of
the
dark
sea
and
a
tiny
can't
say
that
enough
times
and
I'm
gonna
create
another
plane
here
I'm
gonna
pick
up
some
of
the
tree
color
see
how
it
and
all
I'm
doing
is
just
tapping
the
canvas
just
half
I
will
bring
it
right
on
cross
and
the
least
little
touch
more
of
the
sin
look
at
there
I
see
it
creates
a
whole
nother
plane
and
pushes
all
those
trees
back
here
back
into
the
distance
and
that's
super
now
I'm
gonna
have
water
here
so
let's
take
a
little
bit
of
that
color
I
just
pull
it
down
so
we
have
a
little
reflection
I'm
using
just
a
little
bit
of
the
dark
see
on
a
little
Van
Dyck
Brown
on
the
burst
pull
down
and
create
a
reflection
here
just
a
just
a
happy
little
reflection
like
right
there
and
then
lightly
go
across
okay
now
then
then
we'll
take
the
same
little
brush
without
cleaning
it
just
say
well
dirty
brush
and
tap
right
into
a
little
bit
of
the
yellow
ochre
and
the
bright
red
just
tap
it
gently
see
just
tap
ok
now
then
here
this
is
a
little
closer
so
we're
beginning
to
see
an
indication
of
some
highlights
and
same
way
just
gently
gently
tapping
that
was
bright
red
and
a
tiniest
little
touch
of
that
yellow
ochre
now
the
red
is
very
strong
be
careful
with
it
be
careful
of
it
they'll
eat
up
your
whole
world
in
just
a
second
time
take
a
little
brown
it
was
dark
sienna
mixed
together
pull
it
out
cut
across
get
that
small
roll
of
paint
right
on
the
edge
of
the
knife
okay
now
then
just
a
little
lay
on
dedication
right
in
there
just
like
so
juice
okay
scrub
in
across
a
canvas
Tiny's
a
little
bit
add
a
little
white
to
that
same
color
like
that
and
then
just
an
indication
of
a
touch
of
highlight
here
I
don't
I
don't
want
much
highlight
in
this
just
to
touch
here
a
little
bit
of
the
liquid
white
got
across
it
and
we'll
put
just
an
indication
of
a
little
water
right
not
too
much
not
too
bright
okay
yeah
then
go
back
into
my
Browns
CNN
the
Van
Dyke
and
I'm
gonna
grab
some
more
this
tree
color
I
will
put
a
little
peninsula
I
think
it
comes
right
out
here
and
when
you're
doing
this
just
step
back
and
look
at
your
painting
and
make
make
decisions
just
make
decisions
pull
a
little
bit
of
this
color
down
just
a
little
go
gently
gently
across
the
house
same
old
dirty
brush
back
into
a
yellow
ocher
and
bright
red
mixture
just
a
little
same
old
dirty
brush
you
can
get
over
here
a
little
bit
of
this
CAD
yellow
to
it
sorry
yeah
see
follow
the
angles
of
the
land
the
lay
of
the
land
just
follow
it
right
on
to
have
a
brighter
on
top
and
it
darker
darker
darker
as
it
works
down
if
you
want
to
show
a
little
protrusion
here
see
see
that's
easy
that
is
creates
the
illusion
of
another
little
hill
just
by
changing
the
value
of
the
color
or
the
intensity
little
bit
of
that
right
down
to
the
water
go
across
you
have
instant
reflections
let's
play
a
little
bit
over
here
tell
you
what
this
do
we
use
a
round
brush
and
go
right
into
my
Browns
us
the
sienna
and
the
Van
Dyck
tap
out
the
excess
just
go
up
here
back
in
here
there's
some
happy
little
trees
maybe
maybe
these
are
the
birch
trees
and
they
we
back
in
the
distance
just
put
some
little
indications
like
so
like
so
use
the
old
script
liner
brush
just
take
it
a
little
paint
thinner
on
it
go
right
into
the
brown
turn
it
bring
it
to
a
sharp
point
let's
put
just
a
few
basic
very
basic
indications
of
a
tree
branch
here
in
their
little
tree
trunk
I'm
not
looking
for
a
lot
of
detail
same
old
dirty
brush
now
go
into
a
small
small
amount
of
the
yellow
ocher
and
the
bright
red
smallest
little
mount
I'm
just
barely
touching
then
I
want
to
just
touch
right
at
the
top
here
put
some
indications
again
forming
some
basic
little
patterns
and
little
shapes
into
your
trees
don't
just
throw
these
on
random
I
know
I
say
that
in
every
show
but
I
get
the
most
letters
about
that
I
said
my
my
tree
shapes
don't
look
right
and
that's
normally
normally
about
99%
of
the
time
the
problem
is
is
a
color
is
just
throw
it
on
at
random
so
to
look
at
it
practice
it
a
little
practice
here
will
pay
you
tremendous
dividends
tremendous
dividends
just
a
few
little
bushes
and
all
kinds
of
things
okay
tell
you
hardened
punt
a
little
brown
let's
put
a
little
land
area
right
there
see
just
right
there
a
little
bit
of
that
highlight
color
that's
just
a
little
brown
white
not
too
much
just
a
little
here
a
little
bit
of
a
liquid
height
catus
and
a
little
waterline
I'm
going
right
back
into
the
Browns
I
have
yet
to
wash
this
brush
I've
been
going
back
and
forth
between
the
Browns
and
the
highlight
colors
and
now
I'm
gonna
put
another
little
Peninsula
two
lives
right
there
so
you
don't
care
if
the
bottom
of
it
sort
of
comes
down
because
you
just
pull
that
down
mmm
that
easy
that
easy
makes
little
reflections
and
then
flight
ly
like
they
go
across
go
right
into
our
color
how
the
ochre
bright
red

little
house
will
be

a
highlight

rat
off
where
you

a
little
white
on
the
knife

sort
of
highlight
that
and
it
will
take
a
small
edge
of
the
knife
a
little
bit
of
Russian
blue

put
the
indication
of
a
few
little
windows
in
there

that
easy
makes
us
a
happy
little
thing

of
this

little
tiny

bit

Indian
yellow
and
let's
begin
bringing
this
right
down
I
like
this
little
painting
because
it
really
does
give
you
the
feeling
of
fall
so

make
little
layers

things
happening
all
down
through
here
can
tell
you
what
may
be
right
in
here
Leah's
a
little
tree
maybe
that's
just
a
little
maybe
maybe
that's
a
little
birch
tree
like
birch
trees
and
they
usually
grow
in
clumps
so
you
were
to
put
several
Evan
three
aware
that
birch
tree
grows
by
self
he's
a
community
tree
a
little
bit
of
a
liquid
black
and
we
can
just
put
the
indication
of
a
happy
little
limb
here
and
there
that
really
helps
push
your
little
cabin
back
further
into
the
painting
much
further
back
tell
you
what
tell
you
what
let's
have
some
fun

go
back
into
the
Browns

another
little
Peninsula
right
there
and
in
your
world
you
put
as
many
or
as
few
of
these
as
you
want
just
want
to
show
you
how
to
do
it

turn
you
loose
on
the
world

a
decision

it
in
big
ole
tree

this
big
tree
will
help
push
everything
in
your
painting

more
depth
in
your
painting
give
a
big
hole
legal
route

big
tree

to
a
big
route

lay
on
that
comes
right
out

it
on
a
fan
brush

of
these
